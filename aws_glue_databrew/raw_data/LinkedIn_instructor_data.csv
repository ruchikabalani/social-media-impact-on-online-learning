Mjukvaruutvecklare med 10+ års erfarenhet av webbutveckling, .NET, ASP.NET, moln (Azure, AWS). Jag har också erfarenhet av att arbeta med MS SQL, Oracle, MySQL och Postgres. 

Och arbetade också med Python och Rust eftersom de ger bra verktyg för alla programmerare. Och använt Angular, VueJS och React i olika projekt eftersom de är mycket bra ramverk.

Jag gillar att skapa utvecklingsrelaterat innehåll och lära andra hur man blir mjukvaruutvecklare. Jag publicerar också lite arbete på min GitHub-profil om du vill ta en titt https://github.com/amr-swalha, jag publicerade också några NuGet-paket.

Och jag gillar att leka mycket med den senaste tekniken för att hålla koll på de senaste trenderna och räkna hur många JS som finns där ute!",3w,"12,867",406 comments,4mo,5,,4mo,"1,615",102 comments

The company, a bootstrapped enterprise comprising over 40+ enthusiastic individuals, is known for creating compelling content for an expanding global audience. As a deep tech educator, researcher, developer, and consultant, I bring to the table comprehensive knowledge and implementation expertise of emerging technologies, including Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence (AI), SaaS, and many more.

My efforts have not gone unnoticed. I was featured in the Forbes Asia 30 Under 30 list in 2018 for Enterprise Technology and in Forbes India's 30 Under 30 in 2016.

With over a decade's worth of experience in entrepreneurship, management, business planning, financial analysis, software engineering, operations, and decision analysis, I possess the broad understanding necessary to swiftly comprehend business requirements and devise the most effective technology-driven solutions.

My professional journey has been marked by ups and downs, with failures outnumbering successes. I have conceptualized over 50 applications and developed approximately 30. Despite the fact that less than 5% of my endeavors have borne fruit, I am unfazed. My love for converting ideas into products from scratch is unquenchable, and I continue to add to my portfolio.

Prior to the inception of Tosh Innovations in 2017, I founded Wegilant in November 2011, during my master's studies at IIT Bombay. Wegilant earned the esteemed NASSCOM Emerge 50 Award in 2014 and was incubated at IIT Bombay's Business Incubator SINE in August 2013. Under the aegis of Wegilant, we developed Appvigil, a pioneering cloud-based Mobile Reputation Protection Suite for businesses and developers.",5d,14,,2w,14,1 comment,2w,13,

Hi, my name is Brian Jackson.

I was born in the middle of the last century in Los Angeles, California.  After moving for a time to the Silicon Valley, I graduated from Humboldt State University amid the redwoods of Northern California.

Two weeks after graduation I was working as a computer systems programmer for Lockheed Missiles and Space (LMSC) back in the Silicon Valley.  Two months after that and I was married as I have been happily ever since (for 40 years).

After 14 years at Lockheed, I moved from working on IBM mainframes to using PCs running the Unix operating system and encountered a thing called the Internet.  Cisco Systems seemed to be the right place to work, so I joined the company as their 650th employee.  Eleven years later Cisco had grown to over 20,000 employees.

I retired at the age of 48 and instantly became bored!

Throughout my professional career, I'd always enjoyed both writing and providing technical training.  So, I attended creative writing classes at my local junior college and began to write.

I managed to write and self-publish a handful of books, but things didn't take off until my wife, Melanie Jackson, an established author with a New York company, left traditional publishing to join me in self-publishing.

In 10 years, from 2010 to now, Melanie and I have made half-a-million dollars self-publishing well over 100 books.  I also managed to record a pair of audiobooks for Amazon and Audible sale.

By 2014, our rapid rise to Kindle fame had already dwindled.  I decided to pursue my second passion of giving training presentations.

Since 2014 I've published over 48 online video training courses for training sites such as Udemy and Skillshare. My goal is to provide low-cost high-quality screencast-based educational material focusing on my areas of expertise; namely, self-publishing and book cover design using the GIMP.  I continue to expand my video training catalog while focusing some energy on resurrecting our flagging book sales using various marketing techniques.  Finally, I spend a portion of my time maintaining both my website and my wife’s website, which was developed using WordPress.

I currently live in Las Vegas, Nevada, with my lovely wife and Butterscotch the cat.

I'll see you in the classroom,

I built my first electrical circuit at the age of 12, programmed my first C++ application by 14 and decided to pursue Electrical Engineering as a career. Upon graduation, I found myself at a Procter & Gamble manufacturing site where I tackled technical challenges that pushed me to learn, develop myself as a leader and execute multimillion-dollar projects while leading cross-functional teams. This role was fundamental to my career and allowed me to develop key relationships in the industry. Some of the most exciting projects I completed during this time include two-line roll-outs (valued over $20MM each) and a Research & Development project that allowed the production of PocketPearl (Highly successful P&G brand). Due to a desire to gain additional leadership and management experience, I decided to join Kraft Heinz in 2017. At KHC, I was put in charge of 26 mechanics and electricians while trying to manage tight budgets, KPIs and Lean Six Sigma initiatives at a food production facility. I managed to make a positive impact on multiple metrics of the plant, primarily on Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).
