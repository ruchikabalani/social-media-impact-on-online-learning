A few years ago I have seen some of your videos  but then I've lost your channel. Nowadays I'm learning programming again in a more structured form  at a BootCamp but often I have hardships understanding some topic explanations there. Of course  there are hundreds of videos on youtube about each topic  but sometimes they doesn't help me either. Somewhere in my mind  I remembered you  your face  your voice  your explanations  that you were very clear at some topics a few years ago. Today I tried to find you and luckily  I'm here. I have remembered you explaining once that many programmers mismatch the word argument and parameter. This memory led me to succeed in finding your channel. I typed this into the youtube search and I'm glad I got you! I'm going to dig deeper on your channel in the next few months and I think  you gonna be one of my favorite tutors from now on!|@~~@|Super helpful insight into Web 3! The future of the internet sounds interesting.|@~~@|In your Moralis example  does Moralis have the power to view the data before they insert it into the blockchain? If yes  does that leave them exposed to government intervention? Is the data stored by Moralis after being inserted into the blockchain?|@~~@|Very insightful.

If you're interested in learning more  please check the link in the description or email us at admin@inpennystock.com !|@~~@|After a succession of payouts and compounding interest from generating high ROi in trades  it took me me a little over 8 months to hit six figures. sometimes the only challenge we have s taking the first step forward.|@~~@|I like this vid. I also think it's frustrating that so many people advise you to focus on twenty percent or smaller returns. It seems like common sense to invest in cheaper stocks with higher growth potentials. The average person doesn't have a million dollars to invest  so ten to twenty percent returns isn't going to cut it if you want to do this for a living. |@~~@|you make understanding trading stocks so much less complicated then when I listen to other people on youtube speak about stocks|@~~@|Great vid Tim  as always to the point.|@~~@|Really happy I stumbled upon this so early in the morning. Going to stick to that 30% rule as I begin my journey.|@~~@|Subscribed today and I know I'll learn so much. Thnks Tim. Its an Awesome thing you're doing|@~~@|Thank you for speaking in Layman's terms for us that know next to nothing! I will be following your posts attempting to learn. Quick question  do you get a rush or surge of adrenaline ever from penny stocks? I'm easily excitable and can see this as a great investment and fun. I sold off my stocks years ago. Danka  Coca Cola  Disney.|@~~@|Hey brotha  great video. I enjoy listening to you. You explain things extremely well.|@~~@|Thank you for your videos I'm really catching on   I'm positive  this gives me a really good feeling :)|@~~@|I love your video  it makes perfect sense and I am just getting into Trading. you don't have to but the house but you definitely have to reinvest and build your bank!  I'd rather have 35% of $100 000 and 35% of 1000|@~~@|Hey  I'm a 16 year old wanting to know more about trading  I was wondering if these methods still apply to trading nowadays. Thanks for all the informational content.|@~~@|I understand the process now and how to understand not being greedy  reading articles and paying close attention to what company decision. I'm not looking for big risks just something to get a beginner account to gain momentum as you said in the video to be able to risk higher bets and make possible a bigger payout because you took the time to do small but however smart trades. This isn't something im looking to make money on just this  more or less just to be able to fund my hobbies like being a car enthusiast. I just have one question for you  and can you buy and sell stock at anytime? Once you see that it has gone up 30% but you don't want to risk it and it has been an hour since you have BOUGHT or INVESTED in a certain amount of stocks (I hope im correct on that previous statement) can you sell an hour later?|@~~@|learning day by day  i know nothing about stock trading so this video helps me understand somewhat to expect thanks tim|@~~@|I'm 17 and have been searching for good strategies and wanted to know as much a bout penny stocks as possible. You've helped so much. Also is E-trade good for investing? What's the best company to invest through?|@~~@|I'm 15 and I want to learn how to do all this penny stock marketing and this is why I watch you  you are great at what you do  are there any simulators I could start off with so I can learn without losing any money or should I just go straight for it.|@~~@|I'm 14 and I'm so confused on this but it seems really intestine and cool and I want to learn how to do this stuff 
thank you|@~~@|Chad Hart When it comes to penny stocks  a company's underlying business is even more important than it is in exchange-traded stocks. That's because the penny stock world is home to ""shell"" companies that are legally incorporated  but don't have any business operations.|@~~@|Can barely sleep  so excited to start investing tmrw  never even considered taking advantage of the volatility of penny stocks!
Currently in 3rd year for bus management and all of my profs continuously stress not to invest surprisingly..|@~~@|Great statement at the end of cutting your losses  reminded me of the saying ""don't catch a falling knife""."

 https://www.dotnetwebacademy.com/courses/academy?coupon=dnwas23yt|@~~@|One of the best videos I have seen on this topic. Simple  sequential presentation  clear from top to bottom. Thank you very much!|@~~@|Dude you're awesome. I'm a DBA and I've been assigned with creating a web app using C#/NET  and months ago I found your channel.... through these API walkthroughs and other suggestions like MudBlazor/Blazor I've been able to make a pretty legit  fully functioning  low code and maintanable app despite not being a programmer that I'm proud of. Thanks for the videos. Recently did a year of skillshare and ill be checking you out there as well.|@~~@|Greetings from Finland. I shifted over from development to sales over 10 years ago and started to try out coding again   just for fun. The starting up again is a pain as nothing in the code makes sense. I found your tutorial super beneficial and clear. Thanks for this.|@~~@|I'm only 15 minutes into this video but i really  really like your style. I've done a few other tutorials and from what I've seen people either blow through things without explaining or they explain too main minor details without touching on the bigger picture of why things are done a certain way. I can say your tutorial is one of the best I've come across.|@~~@|Thank you for such a clear and simplistic tutorial to grasp some knowledge on the new 7 version. You gained a new subscriber :) Great guy!|@~~@|Thank you for the awesome vid! My only request to make things more clear for us new devs  is could you leave your solution explorer open on the side? I know ultimately I can see where you are based on the tab names  but the solution explorer is more clear.|@~~@|Excellent work @Patrick God   please keep it up and there should be video of real life project example ( user registration  employee registration or a sales invoice ) from creating Table   Strored Procedures  Web Api and Angular|@~~@|Hello  thank you for the tutorial. I was wondering if you are planning to do videos on different authentication methods with users accessing our API?|@~~@|Greetings! You surely have some of the best tutorials in the game! I wanted to know how I would alter the program to use Cosmos DB. I have tried it on my own but seem to run into many issues. Thanks|@~~@|This is the best video I've seen on this topic. You have a talent for explaining things clearly.|@~~@|Hola Patrick  mil y un millon de gracias!  tengo una pregunta:  Si quiero conectarme a mas de una base de datos que tienen la misma estructura  como lo haría?  teniendo en cuenta que el DbContext solo muestra la conexion a una base de datos.|@~~@|Good work sir    on your next vlog please show us how to work on Dbfirst with Indentity and multi relational database|@~~@|Amazing video! Thanks a lot for that.
While you did with SuperHero model  I made with User model and works perfectly. Now  I'm trying creating another models and make the relationships. One more time  thanks for this tutorial!|@~~@|That's AWESOME!Thank you
Also wanted to ask about your course on Udemy(.NET 7 Web API & Entity Framework Jumpstart) do I have to learn basics of Razor pages before watching it or I'll be fine without Razor?|@~~@|I've tried several online courses throughout my Web Developer career. Your videos are the best of used. EXCELLENT|@~~@|I like the design of this version using service and interface to implement dependency injection.|@~~@|Hey Patrick! would you make a video on how to add data access layer to the project? Thanks|@~~@|What are the differences between Web API project using EF and Microservices project using EF? If I have code for the project  how can I find out if it is a Web API project or Microservices project?|@~~@|Excellent tutorial.  Thank you!"

I´ve learned more with this course than with some of paid ones on other sites! Thanks|@~~@|First of all  thank you for the video. One thing should be mentioned in upcoming courses.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher! I listen led to his Alison course and hoped to find a full version for AWS SAA. Thank you Sir |@~~@|Thanks for this great video. I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed! I found this course very illuminating. I especially liked the AWS Codestar and CI/CD pipelines guides. Thank you for sharing your deep understanding in these areas.|@~~@|Hey syed  Love your videos.

I started studying for the solutions architect assiciate exam and I find a lot of things repeating from the previous exam. Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website.

Blender is, quite simply, the best all around 3d software on the planet. Why? Because it's free (as in beer), it's open source, you can use it for anything even commercially, you can interact and influence development directly, and it has the most passionate and friendliest community of any graphics software in the world.

We have a Blender-centric mentality when it comes to training. We don't exclusively teach Blender; however, you'll find that we maintain a focus on Blender and supplement our projects with other software as needed. We don't apologize for using any tool we can get our hands on to do our jobs better. It just happens that Blender solves a lot of problems for creatives on its own.

We provide #tutorials, #inspiration, and #mentorship for #Blender artists. And as a guild, we band together to level up our skills and share our stories with the world. #b3d",,

With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed!

I was working for one employer at the beginning of the year  than laid off  and now having another employer. With the first one  I did not reach 15000 (i got somewhere around a half of that).

If I am filling out a TD1 form for my very first job (no prior income source)  do I still put $15 000 for the basic personal amount?

I requested my employer to give mw a new TD1 form which is now titled as ""2023 Personal Tax Credit Return""  for me to fill out and noticed that I made a mistake and my income tax deductions are very high.

3. Average|@~~@|I really like the teaching style and lessons from Simon Sez  especially this instructor.  I signed up for their Excel Business Analysis course because it had a lot of great worksheets (and others like MS Project  Alteryx  etc ).  Just wish they had these instructions when I started out using the different software (I just find it too challenging to learn from books  or web articles  which was my primary learning method years ago).|@~~@|Hello Deborah and the whole simon sez family  thank u guys very much for this wonderful course. It was learner's centered rather than teacher centered. I just finished it. What a lovely style of teaching.|@~~@|At 5.5 Hours. Best tutorial ever taken. To the point  no fluff. Thank you.|@~~@|Exceptional course!! Well done! Really helpful and totally easy to follow! Keep up the good work :)|@~~@|Your lessons are really wonderful. Thank you so very much. However  under the Randarray assignment where the objective was to generate revenues and profits for the various sales personnel  some profit figures were greater than the corresponding revenues. Is that possible?|@~~@|Its great to be able to do courses like this one  thank you so much for letting me learn for free.|@~~@|Best educational and technical training channel by far. Clarity  Focused and Learner friendly .|@~~@|Very nice teaching style  specific to the point many thanks 3:28:00|@~~@|Thanks for helping me perfect my skills in Excel  your teaching  style is apt and great instructors.|@~~@|I am writing to thank you for the excellent Excel training that I recently completed on your YouTube channel. I learned so much from your clear and concise explanations  and I am now much more confident in my ability to use Excel.



I particularly appreciated the way you took the time to explain the underlying concepts of Excel  as well as the practical applications of these concepts. This made it much easier for me to understand how Excel works and how I can use it to solve real-world problems.|@~~@|Thank you so much for this tutorial  the Instructor has done a superb job  keep it up.|@~~@|Great teaching and i'm enjoying the class  i downloaded the course file but most of the section and exercise files where showing error  the file name has been changed or moved... is there a way these can be fixed?|@~~@|Hi. Firstly  thank you so much for this EXCELLENT course.  I am learning so much.

I will be continuing my journey of learning software development and I am happy to have a more intimate understanding of how computers work. Thank you.|@~~@|Hi mate! A few years ago I have seen some of your videos  but then I've lost your channel. Nowadays I'm learning programming again in a more structured form  at a BootCamp but often I have hardships understanding some topic explanations there. Of course  there are hundreds of videos on youtube about each topic  but sometimes they doesn't help me either. Somewhere in my mind  I remembered you  your face  your voice  your explanations  that you were very clear at some topics a few years ago. Today I tried to find you and luckily  I'm here. I have remembered you explaining once that many programmers mismatch the word argument and parameter. This memory led me to succeed in finding your channel. I typed this into the youtube search and I'm glad I got you! I'm going to dig deeper on your channel in the next few months and I think  you gonna be one of my favorite tutors from now on!|@~~@|Super helpful insight into Web 3! The future of the internet sounds interesting.|@~~@|In your Moralis example  does Moralis have the power to view the data before they insert it into the blockchain? If yes  does that leave them exposed to government intervention? Is the data stored by Moralis after being inserted into the blockchain?|@~~@|Very insightful. Came to learn about Web3 and learnt things I didn't know about blockchain.|@~~@|Spot on  pretty much everything you said is correct here  and then some!|@~~@|does this have implications for carbon footprint of the web?|@~~@|They won't need to harass the company anymore because they can just find it in the blockchain themselves. This is the most foolish endeavor and backwards thinking I have EVER heard of. The security of this is PURELY based on obfuscation.|@~~@|Which blockchain is most Web3 friendly?  Ethereum or some other?  I keep hearing Web3 is Ethereum based... not true?|@~~@|Good job. I think there is also some kind of platform generation difference too. Like Bitcoin is generation 1  Etherium is generation 2  and Polkadot is generation 3."

I´ve learned more with this course than with some of paid ones on other sites! Thanks|@~~@|First of all  thank you for the video. One thing should be mentioned in upcoming courses.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher! I listen led to his Alison course and hoped to find a full version for AWS SAA. Thank you Sir |@~~@|Thanks for this great video. I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed! I found this course very illuminating. I especially liked the AWS Codestar and CI/CD pipelines guides. Thank you for sharing your deep understanding in these areas.|@~~@|Hey syed  Love your videos. Your explanation is from an architectural point of view. Just loving it.|@~~@|very good  and helpful explanation of different fault tolerant architectures it would be good if we get more videos and even on aws solutions  architect professional ml speciality aws certifications very understandable style of explanation for us students  planning to write exam soon|@~~@|Thank you so much for this course.

Super-excited to report that at 7:26:30 AWS has corrected 'Create a environment' to 'Create an environment'  so you don't need to check it yourselves.|@~~@|In this video we are getting high level details which function is used for the particular process  Can you suggest the videos to get the full details like how to create S3 VPC EC2 etc.|@~~@|Great explanation ! keep up the good work going !|@~~@|I just passed the exam.

I started studying for the solutions architect assiciate exam and I find a lot of things repeating from the previous exam. Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website. Do you offer hands on lab for the Associate or should I have my own aws login to do the labs ?|@~~@|Thanks so much. The explanation is very clear.

Digital learning assets have the potential to:
1. 
Make learning more accessible. Today, when almost 
everyone has a sphone or a tablet - and is accustomed to gaining instant access to information - companies have a new opportunity to provide every employee with high quality learning content and just intime performance support on demand, anytime and anywhere.
2. 
Enhance the effectiveness of learning by appealing to 
different learning styles. Studies into how the brain works 
show that we each have our own preferences when it comes 
to learning. In other words, there is a style of training that suits each of us best. Learning styles are often described as being visual, auditory and performing. Certainly, some will prefer face to face training, while others will prefer action learning, reading or watching learning content.",1,"-Excel 2013 Pivot Tables for Newbies ( 7 Lectures only ) (Reduced to £20) http://etrainingfirm.com/course/excel-2013-pivot-tables-for-newbies-7-lectures-only-2/

Business: bemblidesign@gmail.com,29,"I always loved this car  looks a bit exotic and yet so much fun as well|@~~@|Kinda funny how many people say it’s a Camry v6 and do not mention it’s a Lexus engine as well.  It was one of the many selling points for me  such a great engine that’s reliable!  I also prefer the carbon hatch/roof to add some more lightness and also allow the engine to run cooler at the track.  Doing a 3rd cat delete really makes a good sounding car sound great!  It’s how the rest of the world get the Evora!  Bumper wise Lotus tried to bring the GT stateside with the GT430 carbon fiber front end  however it wouldn’t pass crash standards so we got stuck with the Evora 400 front  but received the GT430 carbon rear bumper.  As with many Lotus cars  very under appreciated and I have to say a bit underpowered as well.  Fortunately there are a few ways to add power  that is once the warranty expires!|@~~@|I really like the side profile and the main shape however the front and rear bumper is a bit too overstyled for my taste
Other than that it’s a really cool car~!|@~~@|The venting in the front hood are not intakes. They vent air that comes in from the nose of the car and applies down force as well as use that air for the oil and trans coolers. The intakes are on the sides of the car towards the back|@~~@|Mesh screens are a must have in those rear vents.|@~~@|Thise are not intakes on the hood. They are where the air exits after cooling the radiators. All the styling on this car is functional to add speed and maneuverability. Lotus claims 0-60 in 3.8 seconds in its lightest configuration. This car performs better in every driver's performance area than the Emira.|@~~@|It's not listed on the dealer's website.|@~~@|This car looks awesome. There is just something about the front  I find the headlights beeing a bit too close.
Great video! Thank you <3|@~~@|Please review the Emira too we have a Lotus dealer in Naples with some units|@~~@|Front end redesign looks much better.|@~~@|Get her sold?|@~~@|Are you saying…the engine is from a Camry  ?!?|@~~@||@~~@|Lotus using a Camry engine?

Contato comercial: oialinealbino@gmail.com",142,"adorei o vídeo! há uns dias recebi uma mensagem de uma moça pedindo orçamento  dei meu preço e ela teve a audácia de falar: credo tá caro demais  essa arte eu pego no elo 7 por 10 reais. Nunca me senti tão ofendida na vida  só disse: querida  10 reais não paga meus 4 anos de faculdade nem meus cursos  mas a vontade era de esfregar a cara dela no asfalto kkkk|@~~@|Aline  adorei seu vídeo! 
Eu sou Designer e já recebi proposta de 10 reais para desenvolver uma arte  tem noção? 
As pessoas não entendem que isso leva tempo  dedicação  criatividade e que fazemos por amor.
Concordo com seu vídeo.|@~~@|Parabéns Aline. Fui fazer música ao vivo em um bar da área nobre de Campinas. O dono disse para gente fazer de graça para ele ver se gostava e depois marcaria data. Perguntarmos se poderiamos jantar lá de graça para ver se a comida era boa e depois se fosse de nosso interesse voltariamos para então comer e pagar. Percebe como estão as coisas. Músico estuda  investe. É trabalho.|@~~@|Como eu estava precisando de um vídeo desses. Comecei a trabalhar com arte à pouco tempo e a minha maior dificuldade é quanto cobrar. Em um episódio tive vários comentários que minha aquarela estava linda  porém  foi só eu responder o preço que algumas ""amigas"" abriram a boca para dizer que era muito caro  desvalorizando total todo o meu empenho com os trabalhos  sem contar que material não cai de árvore né?!  Isso me deixou bem chateada  mas vídeos assim fazem eu acreditar que o preço pela minha arte é super justo!|@~~@|Eu amo gente que se valoriza. Parabéns! (Acho que quando um artista não se valoriza  ela acaba desvalorizando todos os outros)|@~~@|Olá Aline  foi ótimo o vídeo. faça mais vídeos assim  os tutoriais são ótimos  mas precisamos destes tipos também. Ah uma ideia  faça algum vídeo falando mais sobre como podemos ganhar dinheiro com o hand lettering. :)|@~~@|É verdade isso viu  a primeira pessoa a valorizar nossa arte somos nós mesmos. Eu faço Scrapbook e muitos acham caro  mas não tem ideia do trabalho que dá!! Temos que valorizar sim!|@~~@|O mínimo que eu cobro em um desenho é 300 reais.
Quando a pessoa oferece 50 reais eu viro as costas e vou embora.
Tão achando que artista trabalha por um prato de comida ¬¬ .
Dê valor no seu trabalho a mão de obra é caro em qualquer profissão.|@~~@|Muito bom este vídeo para me dar mais segurança ao precificar o meu trabalho!Farei o meu primeiro lettering de parede e estou angustiada exatamente nesta parte de dar preço ao trabalho porqu sei que isto é ARTE  e Arte dá trabalho!!|@~~@|Passando aqui de novo só pra avisar que estou usando esse vídeo como referência no meu TCC  com a devida aprovação do meu professor orientador. (E um dos livros que vc recomendou no vídeo também hehe)|@~~@|Eu sempre amei desenho  faz muito tempo que não prático nada  zero! Sou florista e estou  querendo investir numa carreira artística pq eu tenho tempo e vontade e daí achei o Lettering! Estou a poucos dias vendo sobre o assunto e estou bem animada com essa arte e suas dicas foram ótimas!! Obrigada! Mais uma inscrita |@~~@|Quando a pessoa sabe o que faz e se prepara sabe o que cobrar e valorizar o seu trabalho. Parabéns!|@~~@|Adorei seu vídeo! Parabéns por defender que os artistas se valorizem mais! A arte precisa de valorização nesse país. Ps: fiquei com uma dúvida... como você faz para ""regularizar"" cada arte sua de forma que um cliente não pegue a sua arte e diga que era para uso pessoal e use ele para um fim comercial? Já vi um pouco sobre legislação -INPI e direito autoral... Se puder  e se você achar interessante fazer um vídeo sobre eu iria amar! |@~~@|Aline! Vc chegou na minha vida neste momento que estou começando com handlettering e já estava pensando em desistir porque as pessoas pensam que vamos fazer um belo de um desenho quase de graça (vê se pode? Kkkk). Valeu pela ficas e te convido pra dar uma olhada no meu insta @katora.k   beijos|@~~@|Amei  Aline! É incrível como as pessoas não veem nosso trabalho da mesma forma que outros e consideram simples demais ou que não merece tão valor cobrado. Muito importante tu ter aberto essa discussão também  obrigado por isso. Vou buscar os livros que tu indicou pq confesso que não sou muito bom em cobrar  mas preciso dominar isso. Cheiro! <3|@~~@|ameiii o video. Ja me desvalorizei muito por 10  50 e 100. Tem pessoas que ate me bajulam para ganhar um desenho de presente.|@~~@|Gente bem resolvida é outro nível  ADOREI ♡|@~~@|Oi  Aline  já fez um vídeo sobre as frases e os direitos autorais? como saber se a frase que vou usar tem direitos autorais  ou onde encontrar frases que possam ser usadas..|@~~@|Sempre passo por isso! ""É tão fácil isso ai... vai cobrar tanto pra fazer só isso?"".... E o que tem de parente querendo que a gente faça tudo de graça então nem se fala ¬¬'

Amo seus vídeos!!!! Sempre aprendo mto! Obrigada!|@~~@|Muito bom seu vídeo 
Eu tenho 11 anos e faço desenhos e vendo 
Eu acho um absurdo um desenhista receber pouco pelo seu trabalho  e eu sei que dá trabalho"

WOW you guys have really taken video tutorials to the next level!! You guys are LEGENDS!|@~~@|Hats off Darrel to you and your team for putting such an effort behind such an amazing video tutorial every step of the way and on top of that once we learned; handing us fully optimized pages  is even hard to believe so thanks from bottom of my heart. Learning theme builder was a value addition for me indeed.|@~~@|I actually can't thank you enough for the time you have put into this  as well as your other videos. Your videos are well logically placed for any 'level' person to follow. This is by far the best tutorial I have seen!|@~~@|I have to say finally  this video tutorial was very detailed  and it shows you the right path for building an online store  giving you ALL the necessary information. I have seen many video tutorials  but this exceeded my expectations. Thank you so much Darrell  you and your team. After that I can start building my own online store  and I will update you on its progress. Thank you very much again....|@~~@|Excellent content  presented in a very watchable way. I particularly liked the marketing points explained towards the end. Thank you for all the hard work you put in to produce the video.|@~~@|Great way of teaching Darrel. The WooCommerce plugin has been explained in much detail and the creation of the store is handled beautifully...Thank you|@~~@|Darrell  I am impressed with your professionalism. You've got a smooth crisp voice. And your pace during the tutorial is at a perfect pace for me. Thanks for taking the time to bring us this. I am very new to web building   for I am getting prepared to create my first website for a small business I will be starting. I will be using your lesson and Elementor for the task at hand.|@~~@|Darrel!  SINCERELY! Thank you so much for your time in doing this to help so many people  such as my self.  It is truly appreciated and I know many feel the same way as I do. Hope your having a great start to a New Year!|@~~@|Hey Darrel  thanks for the tutorial. How do we get the order confirmed icon to be colored at the order confirmed page? I can only seem to get the shopping cart and checkout icons to be colored at the correct page.|@~~@|This is one of the best tutorials  I have ever watched. I can not finish tutorials mostly  but this time  The length and information are great. He did a really nice job. looking forward to the other tutorials which he mentions in this one. Thank you for amazing information|@~~@|Thank you for the amazing content!! Just want to let you know I faced a few error messages initially when I tried to upload items. Problems regarding the file size and type. Maybe in the next one you could be more specific on that. Another little issue is on the template you provided elementor pro user with  there are a few files which might be problematic  when I tried uploading them it shows ""type product does not exits.""|@~~@|Hi Darrel  I've noticed some online ecommerce stores have multiple tabs that provide additional information (Product Details  Shipping  etc.) in the Single Product Page. Is this an additional purchase of the WooCommerce extensions to get this option or is it just an option (in the free version of Woo) that needs to be turned on in the settings somewhere?|@~~@|The author is great  he explained everything in a clear and understandable way. I learned a lot of new things  thank you.️️️️️️️️️️️|@~~@|A big thank you!  I’m over 60 and not right click savvy and was able to make an e-commerce site by following your simple steps.  I did encounter an error message when editing the actual Shop page  but simply deleted that particular page/ started over again with elated success.  Well done and thank you for making this amazing video.|@~~@|Dear Darrel! Please continue making these great tutorials!|@~~@|Thanks you Darrel!  3 hrs of great content  i apreciate the time and the value that you give us.|@~~@|This is such a helpful video  I'm total newbie and creating my very first website! SOO easy for me to follow along and create as I watch! In the products w/variations  how can I include a blank field for them to add customization? (I personalized the items I sell by adding names  monograms etc.) Thanks!|@~~@|A+ tutorial. This really helped me out.

One question I do have though is how do I configure a digital product that is custom to each customer and will be delivered at a later date (not an instant download).|@~~@|Thanks for the video Darrel! Very insightful and helpful!|@~~@|Can you please arrange your playlist according to the eCommerce website  blogging  SEO  etc?"

I´ve learned more with this course than with some of paid ones on other sites! Thanks|@~~@|First of all  thank you for the video. One thing should be mentioned in upcoming courses.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher! I listen led to his Alison course and hoped to find a full version for AWS SAA. Thank you Sir |@~~@|Thanks for this great video. I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed! I found this course very illuminating. I especially liked the AWS Codestar and CI/CD pipelines guides. Thank you for sharing your deep understanding in these areas.|@~~@|Hey syed  Love your videos. Your explanation is from an architectural point of view. Just loving it.|@~~@|very good  and helpful explanation of different fault tolerant architectures it would be good if we get more videos and even on aws solutions  architect professional ml speciality aws certifications very understandable style of explanation for us students  planning to write exam soon|@~~@|Thank you so much for this course.  I was fearful of doing this on my own because I didn't know the best steps to initially take.|@~~@|I passed the Cloud Practioner exam and now I'm doing the Solutions Architect - this looks like a great place to start |@~~@|Thank you so much for the effort! Was really helpful. God bless you for the hardwork mate!|@~~@|Hey guys. Super-excited to share that I just finished this awesome course.  Thank you Syed and team.  On to the exam.|@~~@|Hey guys.  Super-excited to report that at 7:26:30 AWS has corrected 'Create a environment' to 'Create an environment'  so you don't need to check it yourselves.|@~~@|In this video we are getting high level details which function is used for the particular process  Can you suggest the videos to get the full details like how to create S3 VPC EC2 etc.|@~~@|Great explanation ! keep up the good work going !|@~~@|I just passed the exam. Thank you for this training. |@~~@|Very usefull video...full of comprehensive knowledge of aws components... newbee like me benefits a lot...ClayDesk - Thanks a ton|@~~@|Little part of it is old  but it still worth to watch  thanks a lot for this!|@~~@|I just passed the ccp exam last week. I started studying for the solutions architect assiciate exam and I find a lot of things repeating from the previous exam. Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website. Do you offer hands on lab for the Associate or should I have my own aws login to do the labs ?|@~~@|Thanks so much. The explanation is very clear. You have done excellently sir however  please the advertisements are too many"

It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!! So I wanted to say THANK YOU BRAD  it's always a pleasure to listen to you and in some way you make it so clear and calm me down and show me the way. You are the Jesus of tutorials |@~~@|Brad what you and the Traversy Media Team are doing for the community  you guys are gems  Can't thank you enough for everything you teach us|@~~@|Best 3 hours I have spent on Youtube  period! Most useful and concise video I have encountered in my software development learning journey. It puts everything in perspective and has given me a so much more complete overview of what is out there. Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable! It's hard to keep an overview when having been away from the web dev space for a while  and while some frameworks have been around for years  the landscape is constantly changing and there are just so many topics to keep track of. So thanks for this!|@~~@|The guide many developers have been waiting for.  This channel is a MUST for developers on YouTube.|@~~@|Another year and just like all the ones here in the past I have returned for the daily update! Already a seasoned full stack developer  but nonetheless these videos help me me determine course for the rest of the year. Thanks Brad for making this possible. |@~~@|I hope to land my first coding job this year.  Looking forward to watching this video for help.  Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.
Thank you very much  Brad!|@~~@|Every year i get further in these videos. Its easy to get overwhelmed in web dev  thanks to you i get a breakdown of everything and have a solid roadmap. thank you again this year Brad!"

In a word she is the best teacher out there.|@~~@|I'm taking the course right now and so far  it's really good. I have zero experience in programming but Angela explains it clearly which makes it easier for me to follow.|@~~@|I'm taking the course with Dr.Angela on Udemy. The course really great. Even though I use English as my second language and I have a hard time to speak read and write  but she make the course easy to follow with clear explanation.  Just my opinion She is a the best professor for all developers. I highly recommended her course to everyone.|@~~@|I have both her course and web dev course from Colt Steele. To be honest Angela's course is great  however  she does cut off some basics on the earlier stage of HTML and CSS. For example  earlier on you spent time learning about tables and floats  which is hardly being used now. But she didn't touch about  CSS flex-box or CSS grid. Later when you jumped in framework such as Bootstrap  it was a bit fast  and I'm not against using frameworks  but you really need to have a strong understanding about how HTML and CSS works first  and then you can use frameworks to work faster (if you need it and don't mind the design it gives you). |@~~@|The CSS section is the best hands down. colt  andrei or jonas dont even come close. I used to always fear CSS especially things like display and position but now I feel totally comfortable.|@~~@|Really  she is a great tutor and she gives more informations and resources in this course. I learned a lot from this course.|@~~@|I have been enjoying her class immensely. I do wish I knew the front end and back end earlier. 
The thing that gives me anxiety is not knowing if I could impress potential employers when I finish this course. My intention of to apply for web development jobs when I finish all my Udemy courses.|@~~@|I stopped Angela course when I finished frontend sadly.
Actually she is the best teacher I ever met in my entire life.
She doesn't give you just the content  also she teach you how to walk and tell you how to run the field.
I tried to learn from other tutorials.|@~~@|I am looking for full stack developer course. Should I go with this one or is there any other better options also in udemy?|@~~@|I just bought her course. Can't wait to start!|@~~@|Best teacher ever period.|@~~@|As far as I know node.js is a   javascript runtime environment and not a programming language like you mentioned @4:13 and @4:17|@~~@|Thank you.

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best. What I love most about your tutorials is how you first raise questions  then present the traditional approach and the benefits of using Spring. You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.  Name age address part was pretty much easy... in the end  great tutorial to understand what is going on in the spring but for a begginer like me... I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all... I also understand that you had many things to cover in one single video so you can not go over basic details in it. Thanks :)|@~~@|Many thanks for this smooth and easily understandable tutorial Ranga. I wish you all the best for all your works.|@~~@|Hi Ranga i took your course on udemy  its really good but i have a problem that when i pass some section in course i forgot so many things about it im always getting back on it   and im not sure if i would be able to repeat that code without your videos|@~~@|Great educator!

I have over a decade of experience working as a graphic designer and web developer. I'm also an instructor on Udemy.com with over 100,000 students. My wife and I live in Montana and we have four kids and two dogs. 

Currently I'm focusing on building out this channel to help my graphic design students from my course on Udemy, called, ""Graphic Design Bootcamp: Learn the essentials of Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign while designing real-world projects."" 

You can check out my graphic design courses here: https://www.derrickmitchell.com

I have spent my entire career in the creative arts and marketing sector- starting back as early as high school where I turned homework into paying gigs for clients. My career really took off when I landed a killer internship, getting to work with brands such as MTV, Nintendo, and Netflix. 

There's more to the story, but at least this gets us started. Thanks for stopping by!  -Derrick",4,Thank you so much for sharing Derrick. You're right.

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best.

You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.

I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all...

The core measures about 2-3% lower. So at 5%  I think will come close to matching the core PCE by then if not exceed it  and also they don't need to do it for long - just long enough but it may not be necessary to go that high  things may start to break at 4%.|@~~@|been watching since you had 9k subs  keep doing work for the people we appreciate it|@~~@|thanks for all the hard work with the videos!|@~~@|I would not hate an update on the correlation chart :) however great analysis. thank you|@~~@|As far as bear market correlation  I think this market is most similar to 1970.

My 2 cents -get an advisor to keep you accountable and aid you make better decisions  Marie Freeman has been helping me a lot  all through my journey.

I´ve learned more with this course than with some of paid ones on other sites! Thanks|@~~@|First of all  thank you for the video. One thing should be mentioned in upcoming courses.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher! I listen led to his Alison course and hoped to find a full version for AWS SAA. Thank you Sir |@~~@|Thanks for this great video. I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed! I found this course very illuminating. I especially liked the AWS Codestar and CI/CD pipelines guides. Thank you for sharing your deep understanding in these areas.|@~~@|Hey syed  Love your videos. Your explanation is from an architectural point of view. Just loving it.|@~~@|very good  and helpful explanation of different fault tolerant architectures it would be good if we get more videos and even on aws solutions  architect professional ml speciality aws certifications very understandable style of explanation for us students  planning to write exam soon|@~~@|Thank you so much for this course.

I started studying for the solutions architect assiciate exam and I find a lot of things repeating from the previous exam. Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website. Do you offer hands on lab for the Associate or should I have my own aws login to do the labs ?|@~~@|Thanks so much. The explanation is very clear.

Subscribe to my channel and follow me",100,"Even an experienced developer in a specific field is a beginner in another field so the best thing that Angela is doing is that she focuses on clear and simple explanation with little samples to let us grasp the principal of the course. In a word she is the best teacher out there.|@~~@|I'm taking the course right now and so far  it's really good. I have zero experience in programming but Angela explains it clearly which makes it easier for me to follow.|@~~@|I'm taking the course with Dr.Angela on Udemy. The course really great. Even though I use English as my second language and I have a hard time to speak read and write  but she make the course easy to follow with clear explanation.  Just my opinion She is a the best professor for all developers. I highly recommended her course to everyone.|@~~@|I have both her course and web dev course from Colt Steele. To be honest Angela's course is great  however  she does cut off some basics on the earlier stage of HTML and CSS. For example  earlier on you spent time learning about tables and floats  which is hardly being used now. But she didn't touch about  CSS flex-box or CSS grid. Later when you jumped in framework such as Bootstrap  it was a bit fast  and I'm not against using frameworks  but you really need to have a strong understanding about how HTML and CSS works first  and then you can use frameworks to work faster (if you need it and don't mind the design it gives you). |@~~@|The CSS section is the best hands down. colt  andrei or jonas dont even come close. I used to always fear CSS especially things like display and position but now I feel totally comfortable.|@~~@|Really  she is a great tutor and she gives more informations and resources in this course. I learned a lot from this course.|@~~@|I have been enjoying her class immensely. I do wish I knew the front end and back end earlier. 
The thing that gives me anxiety is not knowing if I could impress potential employers when I finish this course. My intention of to apply for web development jobs when I finish all my Udemy courses.|@~~@|I stopped Angela course when I finished frontend sadly.
Actually she is the best teacher I ever met in my entire life.
She doesn't give you just the content  also she teach you how to walk and tell you how to run the field.
I tried to learn from other tutorials.|@~~@|I am looking for full stack developer course. Should I go with this one or is there any other better options also in udemy?|@~~@|I just bought her course. Can't wait to start!|@~~@|Best teacher ever period.|@~~@|As far as I know node.js is a   javascript runtime environment and not a programming language like you mentioned @4:13 and @4:17|@~~@|Thank you. Very helpful|@~~@|I  as a beginner who is looking to change career paths and has no experience at all like the fact that you are offering to be a mentor. I also wonder if the region that I am from plays a part in what is popular: ie react & ojs etc?|@~~@|Do you have anyone who does mentor programs for the Computer challenged ? I really liked your video on APP development but found it overwhelming.|@~~@|Angela's course are the best.. very inspring too|@~~@|I am a complete beginner who is interested in front developer path.

When we survey people who listen to audio: AM/FM, streaming audio, CD's, TV Music channels, & Sirius, we discover a Power Podcast fact: Podcasts almost beat Am/FM Radio, a mere 1.6% lower in listening time!

If you look at the number of people listening to Podcasts monthly, Podcasts are as popular as Twitter with 39 mIllion listeners.

But instead of communicating in impersonal 150 character Tweets, with Power Podcasting, you get right into the head of your target market for as long as they let you.

Podcasts are portable — and because of this, they are more personal.

Imagine whispering into the ears of your ideal customers every week... building strong relationships, trust and connections. But instead of One-to-One, Power Podcasting is One-to-Many!

I am always coming out with music videos and albums on Spotify. 

One thing I am disheartened about is that rock & roll is not popular as it once was. Some people say rick and roll is dead, but it is not, because there are still three generations of people who have grown up with classic rock, alternative, heavy metal, and punk rock. Rock bands are still out there putting out this music, so rock and roll is NOT dead. It is just less popular than its colleague genres pop, hip hop, and EDM, but rock and roll will never die.",2,Super easy to use! Very user friendly! Thanks for adding this feature!

When I watched the Web Development Practical Guide 2018 almost 5 years ago  I was just coding a “Guess My Number Game” on HTML and now I am watching 2023’s guide as a Full stack Dev with a YouTube channel documenting my progress.

You are amazing Brad.|@~~@|When I was just starting to learn about the front end. Brad was the first content creator/teacher/mentor I connected with and started to understand things. The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes. Thank you Brad. Today I am a senior frontend developer thanks to the basics I learned with you. You are a hero.|@~~@|It's wild that this content just exists out here for free  thanks to Brad's commitment and hard work. You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!! So I wanted to say THANK YOU BRAD  it's always a pleasure to listen to you and in some way you make it so clear and calm me down and show me the way. You are the Jesus of tutorials |@~~@|Brad what you and the Traversy Media Team are doing for the community  you guys are gems  Can't thank you enough for everything you teach us|@~~@|Best 3 hours I have spent on Youtube  period! Most useful and concise video I have encountered in my software development learning journey. It puts everything in perspective and has given me a so much more complete overview of what is out there. Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable! It's hard to keep an overview when having been away from the web dev space for a while  and while some frameworks have been around for years  the landscape is constantly changing and there are just so many topics to keep track of. So thanks for this!|@~~@|The guide many developers have been waiting for.  This channel is a MUST for developers on YouTube.|@~~@|Another year and just like all the ones here in the past I have returned for the daily update! Already a seasoned full stack developer  but nonetheless these videos help me me determine course for the rest of the year. Thanks Brad for making this possible. |@~~@|I hope to land my first coding job this year.  Looking forward to watching this video for help.  Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.
Thank you very much  Brad!|@~~@|Every year i get further in these videos. Its easy to get overwhelmed in web dev  thanks to you i get a breakdown of everything and have a solid roadmap. thank you again this year Brad!"

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes.

You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!!

Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.

Teaching is my Passion and I made it as my profession from last 5 years. It gives me immense pleasure to share the knowledge I have gathered over several years. 
I figured out that, lots of students / professionals want to learn new technologies and improve their knowledge continuously. But due to lack of quality programs, this passion gets hampered.

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional.

There are a ton of new features I am looking forward to including the ease of making an app for the Mac.|@~~@|The tooling seems absolutely awesome and so does the way it automatically adds animation.
The one thing I am not entirely convinced by yet are these methods you call on UI elements to change them  instead of flutters everything is a widget approach.|@~~@|I’m loving it already Brian.

Did you install macOS Catalina on your primary Mac or a spare one?|@~~@|Great Job Brian!  Any idea how something like reordering rows works in SwiftUI and how to update the data object accordingly?|@~~@|Great  I love Swift UI and this tutorial is amazing !|@~~@|Great video  it looks like it's easy but you will have to do some practice to gasp the new concepts. It's a lot faster than doing this with UIKit  I'm missing UIKit already  I just got the hang of it after 3 years and 7 apps. Now it looks like I have to start again...|@~~@|Brian  thank you !!! This video is really in time ! Thank you for your amazing work ;)|@~~@|wow nice tutorial Brian !! is there any documentation of all the syntax in swift UI ?|@~~@|Got a quick question. Is the RAM usage lesser in the swiftUI live preview than in the simulator? I ask because when I run the simulator it takes long to load and it usually takes between 5 to 6 GB of RAM.|@~~@|I needed a short and to the point high quality explanation of SwiftUI  and one name struck my mind:|@~~@|Lovely i really like it and the changes you show together is awersome thanks|@~~@|Great tutorial!
I feel I have a handle on it now. Thanks :)|@~~@|Excellent tutorial. Does the same code run to all apple devices? You could show us on a next video how the same code (with SwiftUI Framework) runs on different apple devices (iPhone  iPad  Apple Watch   Mac  Apple TV).|@~~@|Will anyone show how to place UI elements anywhere on the screen and not just use lists like in every other tutorial about SwiftUI? Also  what about collection views and defining custom layouts? The thing is that every tutorial about SwiftUI is explaining the stackView and lists.|@~~@|Amazing. Thank you so much Brian.|@~~@|Great video  but I wanna know how to create the layout constrain for different iPhone? If I change the device to smaller like a real iPhone SE  it is simply over the view and only 3 rows were displayed  is there something as auto-layout like before to let it adopt for all iPhones?|@~~@|Спасибо за видео ️|@~~@|Hello Brian  Great tutorial man.Just wanted to ask you a little thing.With SwiftUI how we are going to deal with Auto Layout and Adaptive Layout?
Kindly must give answer to this because I hate AutoLayout.
Is SwiftUI will facilitate us or bring ease to ys in terms of AutoLayout?|@~~@|Thanks. Very clear  Very useful."

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(|@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer. There are still so many things need to learn in the Java platform. Do you have any plan to release any new videos/courses on Mockito  Microservice? It’s hard to find good content on those topics. I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

I am very professional in my work but i am totally outdated. i had to start from scratch to learn new technologies and its hard to restart yourself from zero again. most of the people failed and compromise with same old job because of their financial problems. so keep jumping from one point to another point  even water goes bad if it stays in one place.|@~~@|Love the video.  I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.  Couple of things though:  I'm still encapsulated in imposter syndrome when it comes to looking at different opportunities.  How do I ask for 6 figures while dealing with that.

you are doing great work by spreading knowledge...|@~~@|you are 100% correct about the identity.

I just decided to talk a bit more about everything Skip around and use the timestamps if needed.|@~~@|BEAST of a video! Heads up: 31:03 Adobe XD will likely be phased out this year  as Adobe bought Figma. I would not choose XD if you're starting out and are thinking about which UI software to start with. I'd go with Figma personally.|@~~@|For programmers  a new year is incomplete without watching Brad's classic guide on web development. When I watched the Web Development Practical Guide 2018 almost 5 years ago  I was just coding a “Guess My Number Game” on HTML and now I am watching 2023’s guide as a Full stack Dev with a YouTube channel documenting my progress. Thank you very much Brad Traversy and Congratulations on 2 Million subscribers! |@~~@|You are silent for months and we think you are getting your deserved rest  but you return with 3 hours guide tutorial  300 page ebook and a dedicated page with video tutorials following your guide. You are amazing Brad.|@~~@|When I was just starting to learn about the front end. Brad was the first content creator/teacher/mentor I connected with and started to understand things. The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes. Thank you Brad. Today I am a senior frontend developer thanks to the basics I learned with you. You are a hero.|@~~@|It's wild that this content just exists out here for free  thanks to Brad's commitment and hard work. You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!! So I wanted to say THANK YOU BRAD  it's always a pleasure to listen to you and in some way you make it so clear and calm me down and show me the way. You are the Jesus of tutorials |@~~@|Brad what you and the Traversy Media Team are doing for the community  you guys are gems  Can't thank you enough for everything you teach us|@~~@|Best 3 hours I have spent on Youtube  period! Most useful and concise video I have encountered in my software development learning journey. It puts everything in perspective and has given me a so much more complete overview of what is out there. Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable! It's hard to keep an overview when having been away from the web dev space for a while  and while some frameworks have been around for years  the landscape is constantly changing and there are just so many topics to keep track of. So thanks for this!|@~~@|The guide many developers have been waiting for.  This channel is a MUST for developers on YouTube.|@~~@|Another year and just like all the ones here in the past I have returned for the daily update! Already a seasoned full stack developer  but nonetheless these videos help me me determine course for the rest of the year. Thanks Brad for making this possible. |@~~@|I hope to land my first coding job this year.  Looking forward to watching this video for help.  Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.
Thank you very much  Brad!|@~~@|Every year i get further in these videos. Its easy to get overwhelmed in web dev  thanks to you i get a breakdown of everything and have a solid roadmap. thank you again this year Brad!"

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

When I discovered Unreal Engine 4 I was blown away by it's realistic real-time rendering engine!  I immediately saw that Unreal Engine (UE4) was a game changer and that it had now become possible for a small studio consisting of a few artists to pull off a Hollywood quality feature length animated film! 

In the past it would take hours, if not days, to render each frame of an animation, which made it impossible for an independent artist to complete a full length film.  It would literally take years to render all the frames of a movie!

All this has changed with Unreal Engine 4 - the playing field has been leveled and it is now truly up to the talents and skill set of the artist/storyteller to create their vision.  No longer will you be held back due to limitations of technology.

In a word she is the best teacher out there.|@~~@|I'm taking the course right now and so far  it's really good. I have zero experience in programming but Angela explains it clearly which makes it easier for me to follow.|@~~@|I'm taking the course with Dr.Angela on Udemy. The course really great. Even though I use English as my second language and I have a hard time to speak read and write  but she make the course easy to follow with clear explanation.  Just my opinion She is a the best professor for all developers. I highly recommended her course to everyone.|@~~@|I have both her course and web dev course from Colt Steele. To be honest Angela's course is great  however  she does cut off some basics on the earlier stage of HTML and CSS. For example  earlier on you spent time learning about tables and floats  which is hardly being used now. But she didn't touch about  CSS flex-box or CSS grid. Later when you jumped in framework such as Bootstrap  it was a bit fast  and I'm not against using frameworks  but you really need to have a strong understanding about how HTML and CSS works first  and then you can use frameworks to work faster (if you need it and don't mind the design it gives you). |@~~@|The CSS section is the best hands down. colt  andrei or jonas dont even come close. I used to always fear CSS especially things like display and position but now I feel totally comfortable.|@~~@|Really  she is a great tutor and she gives more informations and resources in this course. I learned a lot from this course.|@~~@|I have been enjoying her class immensely. I do wish I knew the front end and back end earlier. 
The thing that gives me anxiety is not knowing if I could impress potential employers when I finish this course. My intention of to apply for web development jobs when I finish all my Udemy courses.|@~~@|I stopped Angela course when I finished frontend sadly.
Actually she is the best teacher I ever met in my entire life.
She doesn't give you just the content  also she teach you how to walk and tell you how to run the field.
I tried to learn from other tutorials.|@~~@|I am looking for full stack developer course. Should I go with this one or is there any other better options also in udemy?|@~~@|I just bought her course. Can't wait to start!|@~~@|Best teacher ever period.|@~~@|As far as I know node.js is a   javascript runtime environment and not a programming language like you mentioned @4:13 and @4:17|@~~@|Thank you. Very helpful|@~~@|I  as a beginner who is looking to change career paths and has no experience at all like the fact that you are offering to be a mentor. I also wonder if the region that I am from plays a part in what is popular: ie react & ojs etc?|@~~@|Do you have anyone who does mentor programs for the Computer challenged ? I really liked your video on APP development but found it overwhelming.|@~~@|Angela's course are the best.. very inspring too|@~~@|I am a complete beginner who is interested in front developer path. Which course is best for me? Colt or Angela course?|@~~@|Your explanation of the cons do offer some different insights. I always get lost in Angela's voice|@~~@|Hi 
Which two courses you recommend to buy after this course?|@~~@|Can you do a video on Advanced courses Java Node Web.. for ex Colt Advanced web dev is very outdated"

You are great teachers! Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them!

Most of my activities have been focussed around growing the GameDev.tv community (www.gamedev.tv) and creating courses to teach folks how to become a game developer. ,153,"The 4 M's of Success

1. Moment
2. Marketing|@~~@|First 45 seconds were so true. It's so amazing creating games because you love to do it even if you don't get paid as much as you could. I can honestly say I'd rather be a one man team  create things I'm interested in and make less than work for a company  create whatever my boss tells me to and make more. It's all about the love for what you do.|@~~@|I'm a developer and I've been learning developing games for 2 months  I made a very simple game just to learn and will start making another  this time to get some return as well. Today I happened to come across some examples of indie games  and lost motivation for the first time in these 2 months. They look nothing like what I can create now or in the near-mid foreseeable future  they are amazing games and I surely can't compete with them  it's much harder than I thought  specially the animation and ""Moment"" part. I won't stop for now  I'm sinking with the ship!|@~~@|Thanks Rick! I'm currently developing an indie title and focusing on these 4 M's and how I'm going to do each of them really helped get me on track  even though it's on a super basic state.
Again  thanks for the help!|@~~@|motivation is the toughest part of the whole process for me  especially when working alone. additionally  the best part of the video hit the nail on the spot when you mentioned that you should not do everything by yourself if you're terrible at a certain part  such as game art.... the game may be awesome  but if it looks like stickmen walking around .... interest may wane....|@~~@|My favorite part of game-making is definitely working in the editor. Figuring out what mechanics I want  and then figuring out how to work them into the product is my favorite part  along with coding.

I love drawing  so concept art/game style is definitely something I can do myself.|@~~@|I’ll have to keep this in consideration when I start making indie games...currently on the road to become an indie developer with a degree in game development...not sure if I’ll go on my own or create some squad with other devs but ill see how it all goes when I get to that point  still a long way to go...I’m more into writing stories and narratives and lore and such though  that’s my talent|@~~@|Hey Rick  love your videos style. I'm heading in a good direction to getting my Kickstarter ready for the public  thanks for the advice. I'll try and stop by here when I have the time.|@~~@|I started to learn how to develop videogames in a Udemy course in which you were one of the teachers. Today  4 months later I have published my first mobile game  it has been a challenge  it is not amazing but I am extremely proud.|@~~@|1: I take this from old games and such. A single moment of just one place  a little platform or area. It's nothing and nothing happening but it feels so comfortable and sucks you in into the environment. Or the gameplay when you do an action and you get this awesome cool interaction that feel realistic cause you did it not a scripted segment and that's what makes a great core game solid. You must love to shoot and fire your guns  feel relief and calm when you find ammo or health when low on a specific gun or feel good and pleasure out of just firing your gun and feeling like the reaction you got was your calculation like in Blood when you know exactly when shooting or throwing dynamite will be successful and impact.|@~~@|Awesome video. Really dig this kind of stuff.
Would like to see more. Keep it up.|@~~@|Winterfell  Rapture  Hyrule and Mushroom Kingdom??? Love the content. You explain things very well.|@~~@|i have published a few things... only made 50 bucks in 3 years.
But my motivation is internalized for life. I won't ever quit.|@~~@|This is the career path I've chosen to go down  even if I am only barely making minimum wage salary  I'll be over the moon. Being someone who's disposition is naturally cynical I would rather earn minimum wage working for myself than having a soul crushing job that possibly pays more.|@~~@|Thanks for the info  man. Just added all of your videos to my watch later playlist.|@~~@|Excellent video my friend 
thank you for such amazing motivation.|@~~@|I made this game called Jealous Bots and it took over six months all by myself. Even after releasing on both iOS and Android  I barely got more than 200 downloads and the game's quality is pretty up to date if you ask me. This is where I learnt how important marketing early on is  besides talking about your game with friends and family. Marketing only AFTER the game has been launched is way harder in my experience. I'll keep working hard though and learn from this for my next game. Cheers Devs!|@~~@|Useful tips  thanks!
Was nice to hear I’m one of the elite because I actually finished a game how I wanted it to be (of course I’m thinking of various ways I can continue to improve it too).
Best wishes to all the other Indie game creators out there!|@~~@|Thanks  I needed this kind of motivation!|@~~@|Hi Rick  could you please provide us with your portfolio of games made by yourself or you and your team? Thanks"

I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community.

Learning theme builder was a value addition for me indeed.|@~~@|I actually can't thank you enough for the time you have put into this  as well as your other videos.

The WooCommerce plugin has been explained in much detail and the creation of the store is handled beautifully...Thank you|@~~@|Darrell  I am impressed with your professionalism. You've got a smooth crisp voice. And your pace during the tutorial is at a perfect pace for me. Thanks for taking the time to bring us this.

Thank you for amazing information|@~~@|Thank you for the amazing content!! Just want to let you know I faced a few error messages initially when I tried to upload items. Problems regarding the file size and type. Maybe in the next one you could be more specific on that. Another little issue is on the template you provided elementor pro user with  there are a few files which might be problematic  when I tried uploading them it shows ""type product does not exits.""|@~~@|Hi Darrel  I've noticed some online ecommerce stores have multiple tabs that provide additional information (Product Details  Shipping  etc.) in the Single Product Page. Is this an additional purchase of the WooCommerce extensions to get this option or is it just an option (in the free version of Woo) that needs to be turned on in the settings somewhere?|@~~@|The author is great  he explained everything in a clear and understandable way. I learned a lot of new things  thank you.️️️️️️️️️️️|@~~@|A big thank you!  I’m over 60 and not right click savvy and was able to make an e-commerce site by following your simple steps.  I did encounter an error message when editing the actual Shop page  but simply deleted that particular page/ started over again with elated success.  Well done and thank you for making this amazing video.|@~~@|Dear Darrel! Please continue making these great tutorials!|@~~@|Thanks you Darrel!  3 hrs of great content  i apreciate the time and the value that you give us.|@~~@|This is such a helpful video  I'm total newbie and creating my very first website!

Teaching is my Passion and I made it as my profession from last 5 years. It gives me immense pleasure to share the knowledge I have gathered over several years. 
I figured out that, lots of students / professionals want to learn new technologies and improve their knowledge continuously. But due to lack of quality programs, this passion gets hampered.

Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.
Thank you very much  Brad!|@~~@|Every year i get further in these videos. Its easy to get overwhelmed in web dev  thanks to you i get a breakdown of everything and have a solid roadmap. thank you again this year Brad!"

Good job Dmytro!|@~~@|Thank you! Very helpful. It is quite challenging to find such a good combination of integrity  consistency and practicality inside one video about Angular. Definitely favorite frontend youtube channel!|@~~@|Another excellent video  Dmytro. Thank you for educating me on the use cases where SOLID could be used with Angular. I will have to re-watch that last Dependency Inversion section a few more times to understand better. Nevertheless  the 40 minutes taken up in this video flew by with so much knowledge you shared. Thank you for being awesome!|@~~@|Thanks a lot for this video. I'm not a native English speaker but I was very impressed that you managed to explain the Liskov principle much better than I heard in my native language. This is because your explanation was from real life but not from books.|@~~@|Amazing video  Dmytro. Do you intend to continue this serie?

Would be great if you create a video about debugging angular memory leaks.  it's an difficult issue to find good references.|@~~@|Hi Dmytro  thank you for all that interesting topics that you covered so far. The way that you are explaining everything in deep is very very good approach and again than you for that. Can I give you an idea to explain the change detection strategy more deeply with couple of examples  thanks in advance ;)|@~~@|Hey Dmytro! You've excellent content  man. I see you're using the Nx console  so how about a tutorial series on Nx? That one would break records!|@~~@|A little side note for the Interface Segregation Principle  since it has a major benefit that maybe isn't clear in the beginning:

The angular lifecycle hooks are a great example since every hook method has its own interface. The benefit of the principle is that|@~~@|I have the same problem now. 
I'm trying to understand the OOP principles and their patterns  but it's still hard to see them in Angular. 
And if you can find examples of principles  it is more difficult with specific patterns  because you read mainly on examples of object-oriented languages  where only one paradigm  and we have OOP  Functional programming  Reactive programming. And you just ask yourself ""The problem is that I do not find them yet  or we just do not have them in JS/TS""|@~~@|I was looking for something like this. Is kind of hard to understand this concepts but with easy examples as you showed  is just simple ! thanks|@~~@|Hi 

Thanks for this good stuff. Can you please make a tutorial on view encapsulation and change detection?|@~~@|Would you consider mixing Generics into these examples?  Do you use Generics?|@~~@|This contains video invaluable information.
Thank you very much for putting the time and effort creating this.
The example is fantastic with the right mount of complexity to deliver the learning lesson.
Thank a lot. Keep it up. I really like the content you are making.|@~~@|Great content man 
Such an amazing explanation with a real example.|@~~@|Your channel was the biggest finding for me! Great content  tackling advanced concepts which aren't really explored in other places!
I have a question/request: is there a best practice about domain models in an Angular project? I work on a really big project with multiple frontends and a shared library. The data model is really complicated and it resulted in a lot of heavilly coupled interfaces/classes.|@~~@|Hey Dmytro  Just a thought that we can mark properties optional in interfaces in that way we need not to make multiple interfaces.

When I discovered Unreal Engine 4 I was blown away by it's realistic real-time rendering engine!  I immediately saw that Unreal Engine (UE4) was a game changer and that it had now become possible for a small studio consisting of a few artists to pull off a Hollywood quality feature length animated film! 

In the past it would take hours, if not days, to render each frame of an animation, which made it impossible for an independent artist to complete a full length film.  It would literally take years to render all the frames of a movie!

All this has changed with Unreal Engine 4 - the playing field has been leveled and it is now truly up to the talents and skill set of the artist/storyteller to create their vision.  No longer will you be held back due to limitations of technology.

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best. What I love most about your tutorials is how you first raise questions  then present the traditional approach and the benefits of using Spring. You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.  Name age address part was pretty much easy... in the end  great tutorial to understand what is going on in the spring but for a begginer like me... I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all... I also understand that you had many things to cover in one single video so you can not go over basic details in it.

I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well. Thank you so much!|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir  ....u r always wonderful at your explanation...I m one of u  r student at Udemy .|@~~@|Thank you so much Rahul. This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.  Requesting you to modify the answer on video 26:41|@~~@|Thank You Rahul Sir that was amazing refreshing session. Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!!

Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable!

Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.

You are great teachers! Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them! Really nice work  i think i am going to take the full course !|@~~@|Great work!

I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course.

The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches.

Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.

Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this.

I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful.

Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.

Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this.

The course is inspiring and I look forward to more courses in the future from the creator of the course. Thank you Pixel Helmet!

I know my question might be stupid and baseless but as a fresher in Automation/SDET I always wonder about this as I want to continue growing in the automation field and which is what motivated me to switch from development....But this one question always keeps me down and bothers me a lot in my path....I dont know why but my developer friends always tell me ""You should be in development as the focus more now is shifting towards developer doing everything rather than having a separate qa automation sdet ....Developer also does some automation in some companies .....This is what my friends tell me and which bothers me a lot .....I igonre them But as a human having little experience in automation what is your take on this? I know this might be a stupid question that only a fresher can think of but my friends always warn me that future is more towards the developer doing everything and no separate tester will be required.....I 100 percent dont want this to be true as I love automation but one time I want to listen to your thoughts on this and clear my stupid doubt(even if this question pisses you off) You are my teacher so I ask you as a student the reality of this |@~~@|Hi Raghav

My goal is to teach anyone ( no coding experience necessary) to build android apps and become a well-rounded developer in the process.

This is the vision we have behind all of our courses 'Step by Step'
1. Start from scratch
2. Break down the topic
3. Simplify things
4. Go step by step

Teaching is my passion and I design every course so you can start from scratch, knowing nothing about a topic and become an expert after the course and can work on enterprise projects.

I am working as SDET III and DevOps in IT industry and having experience on many technologies.
Do not worry if you do not have any existing knowledge on the subject. We will go very basic, step by step.

You are great teachers! Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them! Really nice work  i think i am going to take the full course !|@~~@|Great work!

I am new to automation testing and just have switched from development to Automation Testing.....
I know my question might be stupid and baseless but as a fresher in Automation/SDET I always wonder about this as I want to continue growing in the automation field and which is what motivated me to switch from development....But this one question always keeps me down and bothers me a lot in my path....I dont know why but my developer friends always tell me ""You should be in development as the focus more now is shifting towards developer doing everything rather than having a separate qa automation sdet ....Developer also does some automation in some companies .....This is what my friends tell me and which bothers me a lot .....I igonre them But as a human having little experience in automation what is your take on this? I know this might be a stupid question that only a fresher can think of but my friends always warn me that future is more towards the developer doing everything and no separate tester will be required.....I 100 percent dont want this to be true as I love automation but one time I want to listen to your thoughts on this and clear my stupid doubt(even if this question pisses you off) You are my teacher so I ask you as a student the reality of this |@~~@|Hi Raghav

Thanks again |@~~@|Hey Raghav Hope you see this comment .....
I am new to automation testing and just have switched from development to Automation Testing.....
I know my question might be stupid and baseless but as a fresher in Automation/SDET I always wonder about this as I want to continue growing in the automation field and which is what motivated me to switch from development....But this one question always keeps me down and bothers me a lot in my path....I dont know why but my developer friends always tell me ""You should be in development as the focus more now is shifting towards developer doing everything rather than having a separate qa automation sdet ....Developer also does some automation in some companies .....This is what my friends tell me and which bothers me a lot .....I igonre them But as a human having little experience in automation what is your take on this? I know this might be a stupid question that only a fresher can think of but my friends always warn me that future is more towards the developer doing everything and no separate tester will be required.....I 100 percent dont want this to be true as I love automation but one time I want to listen to your thoughts on this and clear my stupid doubt(even if this question pisses you off) You are my teacher so I ask you as a student the reality of this |@~~@|Hi Raghav 
Thanks for your all resources as its all very helpful for automation testing. I subscribe on 54999 now you have 55000k subscriber. congratulation !!!

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan. I have a challenge after attending your course on kalman filter. It's a personal stuff  and would like to communicate to you over your email.

Any chance you could make it in the style and camera angle of Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSX? This could open the development of a whole new subgenre in GMS2.3; Isometric 3D games.

I got a question through. I see your game play videos and when you have that ""3D"" effect  its always at an angle. Could I just make it so that it dosent havevthat angle but have a 3D perspective in a normal view?|@~~@|Really awesome Tutorial as always thank you :)|@~~@|Hello  do you have a 3D collisions tutorial with this example? I wanna do a Paper Mario inspired game and this was the better and most effective tutorial i could find. Thank you for you help.|@~~@|2 questions 1 is there a way to rotate the camera around the player 360 and 2 is it possible moving the character on through the depth z if he still keeps his normal x and y platform movement|@~~@|This is really cool! But do you have advice on how you would make the 2.5D camera have some natural drift  so that it is not locked onto the player character? I'd like the camera to have to ""catch up"" to the player slightly. Thanks for your time. Cheers.|@~~@|I'm struggling with something. I wanted to use this script for props for a top down game. But for some reason the textures are getting squished in various amounts in various directions. do the textures have to be perfect squares? because I tried that but it only seems to work sometimes.|@~~@|I already bought two of your courses on Udemy  I'm already starting them. There would be a way for you to do a course or some tutorials to create a farm simulator  like Stardew Valley|@~~@|Can you make a tutorial like this for top down 3D?|@~~@|I seem to be having a problem where the top face isn't displaying where the collision for the wall actually is  I've poked around for a solution and can't find one. any help?|@~~@|Hi 

I would like to know if it is possible to control the player with our device.

You are great teachers! Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them!

I was curious if you would ever consider doing a condensed course on game optimization?

Quick one at 16:55 you make a search  how did you bring up that floating window?|@~~@|Will the course eventually be offered on Udemy or some similar site  so that those of us in the third world can have regional pricing?

I feel a little intimidated to take any of your courses since I have no CS background or programming experience at all. I took udemy courses on C++ and I know how variables  functions  Enums  Loops structs  constructors   work. Also basics on pointers  stack and heap but again never used it in a real project  only short programs on the cmd. Can I take this course? or Should I keep practicing until I feel comfortable with the language itself before diving into Unreal´s C++. I´ve been working with Unreal for a year and half now and always used Blueprints. Thanks in advance for any guidance. |@~~@|Just signed up!  Excited to learn more about Unreal.|@~~@|Tom  I would love to do one of your courses. That co-op horde project looks like great fun  but I don't know sh1t about C++.

The apps come as a 4-app course, and focus on business ideas, business plans, marketing and fundraising. The reason the channel focuses on these 4 topics is that this is precisely what entrepreneurs struggle with the most. After 500,000 downloads, I consistently observed that people had difficulties with business ideas, creating a business plan, marketing, and raising money.

Take my business course on how to start a business with 5 hours of tutorials:

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best.

You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.  Name age address part was pretty much easy... in the end  great tutorial to understand what is going on in the spring but for a begginer like me... I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all... I also understand that you had many things to cover in one single video so you can not go over basic details in it.

I´ve learned more with this course than with some of paid ones on other sites! Thanks|@~~@|First of all  thank you for the video. One thing should be mentioned in upcoming courses.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher!

I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed!

Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material?

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community.

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best. What I love most about your tutorials is how you first raise questions  then present the traditional approach and the benefits of using Spring. You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.  Name age address part was pretty much easy... in the end  great tutorial to understand what is going on in the spring but for a begginer like me... I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all... I also understand that you had many things to cover in one single video so you can not go over basic details in it.

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(|@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer. There are still so many things need to learn in the Java platform. Do you have any plan to release any new videos/courses on Mockito  Microservice? It’s hard to find good content on those topics. I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

Thanks for sharing this wake up call for identity protection.|@~~@|I worked in a company for ten years suddenly they closed it. my life suddenly went dark... I am very professional in my work but i am totally outdated. i had to start from scratch to learn new technologies and its hard to restart yourself from zero again. most of the people failed and compromise with same old job because of their financial problems. so keep jumping from one point to another point  even water goes bad if it stays in one place.|@~~@|Love the video.  I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.  Couple of things though:  I'm still encapsulated in imposter syndrome when it comes to looking at different opportunities.  How do I ask for 6 figures while dealing with that.  Secondly  where are those 6 figure jobs?  I'm in the Portland Oregon area and am not seeing much that I would qualify for with only 2 years.|@~~@|On this July 31 (within one month) I will complete two years in my current company and accidentally YouTube suggests me this video. How lucky am I !! Really helpful video ️|@~~@|Perfect time for this video. I've been working in my first job for over 2 5 years.|@~~@|You're right Ahmad  if you dont have any more things to learn  it's better to change.
But what do you think about changing in this pandemic time? Is it a good idea? What do you think?|@~~@|Thank you so much sir for  your advice. waiting for lesson 11 and on...
you are doing great work by spreading knowledge...|@~~@|you are 100% correct about the identity. I havejust completed 2 years at my company as an entry lvl data analyst and they still view me as a junior  it is very true that your bosses won't let you come up and give you a raise because they still view you us a jr.
Time to lvl up!!!|@~~@|A collegue of mine told me the exact same about the salery. They wont increase your salery big time because then they need to do that for everyone. They would risk the few that leaves|@~~@|Woow  i got a new job after 11 years on my first tech company! I can't really belive that this video was released when i was searching if i should move on or not. Now on this new IT company working almost 3 month i will say that all he talks in the video is TRUE! And most important guys & girls  the Identity. Its all on you what you want people to know about you in your next work.|@~~@|Hi Imtiaz i want to learn python for data science and machine learning  i have taken a few courses on udemy and coursera  but i mainly find them too superficial and not in enough depth  any suggestions? or is something related coming on job ready programmer  soon ? :)|@~~@|3 years i had 4-5 jobs. Not a software developer but still it's cool to have experienced 2 foreign countries and work in different environment... |@~~@|I'm a data analyst and I have learnt SQL using your course and want to start my career as a SQL Developer.  Do you recommend finding a junior level job first even though the pay might be lower than my current role?Thanks|@~~@|I wish I had seen this or got some advice like this when I was a fresher. I ended up staying 8 years in the same company |@~~@|Agreed... Switching is easy way to grow early in your career|@~~@|Thank a lot @Ahmad your advice is helping me to grow in software development  though am still learning am into JSVAFX framework now.|@~~@|I have been with the current employer from the last 8 years :( .

8:28 API is the best form for automation
10:34 REST API|@~~@|Hi Rahul  
I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well.

This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.

Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher!

It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed!

I started studying for the solutions architect assiciate exam and I find a lot of things repeating from the previous exam. Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website. Do you offer hands on lab for the Associate or should I have my own aws login to do the labs ?|@~~@|Thanks so much. The explanation is very clear.

I have remembered you explaining once that many programmers mismatch the word argument and parameter. This memory led me to succeed in finding your channel.

Get in touch with me anytime if you have questions, suggestions, or want to collaborate.",337,"As you pointed out  maps became standard in Fantasy novels. I was a kid in the '70s and when a new book hit the shelves checking out the map in it was a big part of deciding whether to buy it. The deciding factors were just as you described. There was an art to it and blank space was important - something akin to Tolkien not fully explaining Tom Bombadil  letting us wonder. I remember looking at a book and rejecting it because the map was so filled in  so complete  and surely the story couldn't include all these places and if it did it was going to be tedious.|@~~@|In a weird way  this a perfect way to explain Tolkien's genius.... The story  the plots  the characters  the themes  the languages and lore  the rich world building...

He also created the arch type fanatasy map. He was ALSO badass at creating a fictional map.|@~~@|This map is so beautiful  I made it a centerpiece of the art in my library. I ordered the largest copy I could find  had it framed and it proudly takes up most of one wall in my library  surrounded by other  smaller works of art by cover artists I enjoy (including Tolkien artist Alan Lee).|@~~@|I love that you said it feels like Tolkien is just the first explorer and the person destined to share the stories written by Frodo  Bilbo and Sam (to a lesser degree) with us  maybe with the intention to show that despite all peril and evil forces against us there is hope and things we can do to influence the world for the better.|@~~@|I am so glad you mentioned _The Atlas of Middle Earth_.  There aren't enough people who know about this wonderful book  and reading the novel with this atlas open is an incredibly fun exercise.|@~~@|Morgoth raised the Misty Mountains to hinder Orome from roaming around freely. Sauron raised the mountains around Mordor as defence and for ""privacy"". 

It's such a marvelous map  It inspired me to make my own maps  although by using a program not by hand drawing.|@~~@|Always whenever I read the lord of the rings  I find myself keeping track of the adventures of the fellowship  whenever I had to close the book. Running my fingers over locations  rivers and mountain ranges; it makes you feel like a modest historian of middle earth. Long live Tolkien|@~~@|As a would-be author myself  having just as much trouble and fascination with fantastic cartography  it is reassuring to know that even the best fantasy author struggled with maps. Making maps is incredibly hard work.|@~~@|There is also ""The Journey's of Frodo"" by Barbara Strachey which is a cartographer's guide to Frodo and Companies journey. It is pretty interesting and shows the actual travel by Frodo and company. Where they were on the map during the story.|@~~@|I helped to embroider these maps onto a tablecloth for a friend's custom van around 1978. Only thing I ever sewed. It was a project for anyone who stopped in and it took weeks.|@~~@|I´ve drawn the third age map by hand and to scale and I can say that it is incredibly detailed. I´m starting to draw a map combinig 1st and second ages and maybe later I´ll draw even more Micro maps of areas like the Shire.

These maps are a treasure and I feel like they actually land the fantasy world on a ¨possible¨ and ¨tangible¨ manner. Almost as if you could study it.|@~~@|One thing that has differentiated you in this very moment from others who speak of the writings and the work artwork of JRR Tolkien  is that you have not only included Christopher in your mentions but you give them credit as the Tolkiens. They were indeed a team. Although j.r.r. started this and wrote the basics all of the history all of the details  it was Christopher it was Christopher who did as much work as his father.|@~~@|You have highlighted the two greatest strengths of Tolkien  along with the meaning and philosophy behind it- which is Tolkien's extensive attention to detail in a coherent picture of a world  and his soft  poetic inviting warmth  like a warm fire in a hobbit-hole by the side which stories are told.
Tolkien's maps have both of these qualities to a wonderful degree!|@~~@|2:29 As a kid in the 70s  this map was like a real world map to me. I used to just sit down and gaze at this map.|@~~@|One of my favorite details of these maps is Beleriand under the sea  hearkening back to medieval legends of the drowned realms of Ys and Lyonesse.|@~~@|As a lifelong enthusiast of both Tolkien's works and maps in general  I was always fascinated by the Sea of Rhun  which I always thought resembled the head of a lynx in shape.  I was mildly disappointed that no part of the story went to that region to reveal more information about it.|@~~@|I can't imagine the bizarre geologic events that would produce such a peculiar topology.|@~~@|I've been world-building and drawing maps of the places I've imagined for over 40 years of my life.  This map  created by Tolkien & Son was the template that started me.  Your video warms my heart and makes me feel a connection to Christopher  drawing these imagined worlds with pen on paper.|@~~@|What a superb video. So much information and a lovely measured pace and tone.
The examples of the maps from other books that could have influenced Tolkien  were simply fascinating.   That is proper first rate scholarship.  
I was surprised  but absolutely should not have been  to find out how much work and sweat went into the maps  and the degree of collaboration. |@~~@|13:22 That is a map of the 4th Division objectives on the Ancre front for the Battle of the Somme on July 1 1916. Except for one exception   none of the objectives were achieved and the Division was back where it started   minus 5800 casualties."

The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes. Thank you Brad. Today I am a senior frontend developer thanks to the basics I learned with you. You are a hero.|@~~@|It's wild that this content just exists out here for free  thanks to Brad's commitment and hard work. You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!! So I wanted to say THANK YOU BRAD  it's always a pleasure to listen to you and in some way you make it so clear and calm me down and show me the way. You are the Jesus of tutorials |@~~@|Brad what you and the Traversy Media Team are doing for the community  you guys are gems  Can't thank you enough for everything you teach us|@~~@|Best 3 hours I have spent on Youtube  period! Most useful and concise video I have encountered in my software development learning journey. It puts everything in perspective and has given me a so much more complete overview of what is out there. Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable! It's hard to keep an overview when having been away from the web dev space for a while  and while some frameworks have been around for years  the landscape is constantly changing and there are just so many topics to keep track of. So thanks for this!|@~~@|The guide many developers have been waiting for.  This channel is a MUST for developers on YouTube.|@~~@|Another year and just like all the ones here in the past I have returned for the daily update! Already a seasoned full stack developer  but nonetheless these videos help me me determine course for the rest of the year. Thanks Brad for making this possible. |@~~@|I hope to land my first coding job this year.  Looking forward to watching this video for help.  Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.
Thank you very much  Brad!|@~~@|Every year i get further in these videos. Its easy to get overwhelmed in web dev  thanks to you i get a breakdown of everything and have a solid roadmap. thank you again this year Brad!"

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best. What I love most about your tutorials is how you first raise questions  then present the traditional approach and the benefits of using Spring. You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.  Name age address part was pretty much easy... in the end  great tutorial to understand what is going on in the spring but for a begginer like me... I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all... I also understand that you had many things to cover in one single video so you can not go over basic details in it. Thanks :)|@~~@|Many thanks for this smooth and easily understandable tutorial Ranga. I wish you all the best for all your works.|@~~@|Hi Ranga i took your course on udemy  its really good but i have a problem that when i pass some section in course i forgot so many things about it im always getting back on it   and im not sure if i would be able to repeat that code without your videos|@~~@|Great educator!

First few questions itself were good enough to crack the interview and display confidence. Once again many thanks.|@~~@|00:42 Challenges
07:03 Authentication
8:28 API is the best form for automation
10:34 REST API|@~~@|Hi Rahul  
I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well. Thank you so much!|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir  ....u r always wonderful at your explanation...I m one of u  r student at Udemy .|@~~@|Thank you so much Rahul. This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.  Requesting you to modify the answer on video 26:41|@~~@|Thank You Rahul Sir that was amazing refreshing session. Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

This is specific to arrow functions  and can only be used if the function can be written as a single expression. If you need a block body  you do need an explicit return statement. Just thought it's worth mentioning because people might come across code that looks almost like the example but which actually works.|@~~@|I have been working in the industry for a couple of years now.  Most of what you mentioned would have been very helpful to know back when I started.  I admit there are a couple of those that I still struggle to remember to do  i.e. handling errors and knowing if a method or extension is a mutator or asynchronous.  Thanks for the reminders and for making me aware of how much I have grown as a developer.  Things like this help me to prepare for being a better mentor as well.  I think it is easy for us to forget what the exact struggles we went through on our journey.  Your videos are always helpful in either teaching something new  reminding me to do things the right way  or keeping me aware of the things I should help pass down to the next new developer.|@~~@|Just a small note  you can keep script in the head of the document  but you should add defer attribute to it and it would solve the issue)|@~~@|Thanks  it was great to see I'm not alone making these beginner's mistakes! Great way of explaining!|@~~@|First of all  I would like to wish you good luck on this ""new path"" working full time here.

I hope you enjoy it and that you have way more return than effort making these awesome videos.
Also I'm quite happy to realise that I usually don't make most of these mistakes and as a beginner
it's hell of incentive. Thanks James  for real!!!|@~~@|Note: arrow functions DO return values (implicitly). This would have worked ""const getAddedValue = (a  b) => a + b"" without using return.|@~~@|The biggest mistake that I personally make is not coding every  single  day. Gotta be in it to win it  thanks @James Q Quick! |@~~@|In this example you gave concerning the object vs primitives comparison  is this situation only specific to objects  or does it include other non-primitive data types?|@~~@|Excellent video !
Thanks for sharing  James.
Using most of these ""pitfalls"" during a first interview ..
Just as an info ...|@~~@|i will make my recommendation before watching the whole video  when you guys are programming in JS  use a well configured linter  like ES lint for example  it can show bad javascript in red (like errors) it will compile anyways  but you will have the chance to correct them before compiling.|@~~@|Thank you. Interesting. In the hasEvenNumber function  the retVal variable remained  which is not used|@~~@|I would put into beginner mistakes as well when someone creating a variable with an anonymous function as a value instead of using function keyword. :)

joking apart  could you please explain why do you prefer anonym functions as variables than named functions? the former is a function acting as data. why using a function as a data when there is a way to create a function just to be a function?  ...and functions with names are better for debugging. functions as data should be used for example to work with higher-order functions.|@~~@|Thanks for the useful video  Just a quick note in 9:50 condition of for loop i must be less than names.length not arr.length also in second line access to it by names[i] not arr[i]|@~~@|Thank you  as I watch many people  I've learned shorter ways  but not always the best or most descriptive  here are a few. 
- defer your js file like so.  <script src=""./myScript.js"" defer > </script> in the Head.
 - isOdd can be shorter like so  const isOdd = num => (num % 2 === 1)
 - err && console.error(err)|@~~@|would you ever make a video like this about React? I'm going through it currently and trying to avoid the crap I did with vanilla |@~~@|Hi James  in VS Code what’s the fastest way to type “const” … is there a shortcut? Like  a way to generate it faster than typing 5 chars.|@~~@|20:00 and 23:15  Objects in JS  unlike primitive types  are passed by reference  then you are  essentially  messing with the same object. Be careful here.|@~~@|I’ve been told it’s better practice to store the JS file in the head with all other meta data and just defer it.

Found the channel via Spring Boot 2.6 video.

A recommendation I have is to use the same microphone while talking in-front of the camera as the one you are using when writting code (the second microphone is way better quality in my opinion)  because the difference between them is very clear and could irritate some viewers slightly.|@~~@|I was using a lot of that stuff and had kind of an idea of why I was using it but your take is super simple  thank you  it was an incredible back to the basics|@~~@|A nice set of videos Dan.

This leaves me with a rather rudimentary question.
Since it is fully possible to code constructor injection (with arguments) without the Spring Framework (since this is how I've been doing dependency in my non-Spring code bases like AWS Lambdas)  what are the other benefits that are provided by Spring  purely from the standpoint of constructor injection? In the grand scheme of things  agreed that Spring does a lot more under the hood but just wanted to understand the |@~~@|Your videos on a level that explains things so well  great stuff  as always Keep up the good work  you're helping me so much! Great content  as always  so clear and well structured  Dan is the best instructor ever! Deep dive 27:41 please 

This video justcame up the right time. I always have some problems understanding how to connect beans the right way  also with JPA or other frameworks  maybe mixed with streams/collections and debugging(!) them correctly. |@~~@|really good content! i always made constructor injection cause my lead told me to  but i never knew why. Thank you!|@~~@|very interesting and really clear explanation of why we use these concepts .. thank you :D|@~~@|What's the difference between these two ways you are instantiating the object of VideoRepository at following timestamps :

How does the private final field  and the loaded constructor affect Jpa?  -- would a second empty controller be required?|@~~@|really clear to understand.

Thanks again |@~~@|Hey Raghav Hope you see this comment .....
I am new to automation testing and just have switched from development to Automation Testing.....
I know my question might be stupid and baseless but as a fresher in Automation/SDET I always wonder about this as I want to continue growing in the automation field and which is what motivated me to switch from development....But this one question always keeps me down and bothers me a lot in my path....I dont know why but my developer friends always tell me ""You should be in development as the focus more now is shifting towards developer doing everything rather than having a separate qa automation sdet ....Developer also does some automation in some companies .....This is what my friends tell me and which bothers me a lot .....I igonre them But as a human having little experience in automation what is your take on this? I know this might be a stupid question that only a fresher can think of but my friends always warn me that future is more towards the developer doing everything and no separate tester will be required.....I 100 percent dont want this to be true as I love automation but one time I want to listen to your thoughts on this and clear my stupid doubt(even if this question pisses you off) You are my teacher so I ask you as a student the reality of this |@~~@|Hi Raghav

Most of my activities have been focussed around growing the GameDev.tv community (www.gamedev.tv) and creating courses to teach folks how to become a game developer. ,153,"The 4 M's of Success

1. Moment
2. Marketing|@~~@|First 45 seconds were so true. It's so amazing creating games because you love to do it even if you don't get paid as much as you could. I can honestly say I'd rather be a one man team  create things I'm interested in and make less than work for a company  create whatever my boss tells me to and make more. It's all about the love for what you do.|@~~@|I'm a developer and I've been learning developing games for 2 months  I made a very simple game just to learn and will start making another  this time to get some return as well. Today I happened to come across some examples of indie games  and lost motivation for the first time in these 2 months. They look nothing like what I can create now or in the near-mid foreseeable future  they are amazing games and I surely can't compete with them  it's much harder than I thought  specially the animation and ""Moment"" part. I won't stop for now  I'm sinking with the ship!|@~~@|Thanks Rick! I'm currently developing an indie title and focusing on these 4 M's and how I'm going to do each of them really helped get me on track  even though it's on a super basic state.
Again  thanks for the help!|@~~@|motivation is the toughest part of the whole process for me  especially when working alone. additionally  the best part of the video hit the nail on the spot when you mentioned that you should not do everything by yourself if you're terrible at a certain part  such as game art.... the game may be awesome  but if it looks like stickmen walking around .... interest may wane....|@~~@|My favorite part of game-making is definitely working in the editor. Figuring out what mechanics I want  and then figuring out how to work them into the product is my favorite part  along with coding.

I love drawing  so concept art/game style is definitely something I can do myself.|@~~@|I’ll have to keep this in consideration when I start making indie games...currently on the road to become an indie developer with a degree in game development...not sure if I’ll go on my own or create some squad with other devs but ill see how it all goes when I get to that point  still a long way to go...I’m more into writing stories and narratives and lore and such though  that’s my talent|@~~@|Hey Rick  love your videos style. I'm heading in a good direction to getting my Kickstarter ready for the public  thanks for the advice. I'll try and stop by here when I have the time.|@~~@|I started to learn how to develop videogames in a Udemy course in which you were one of the teachers. Today  4 months later I have published my first mobile game  it has been a challenge  it is not amazing but I am extremely proud.|@~~@|1: I take this from old games and such. A single moment of just one place  a little platform or area. It's nothing and nothing happening but it feels so comfortable and sucks you in into the environment. Or the gameplay when you do an action and you get this awesome cool interaction that feel realistic cause you did it not a scripted segment and that's what makes a great core game solid. You must love to shoot and fire your guns  feel relief and calm when you find ammo or health when low on a specific gun or feel good and pleasure out of just firing your gun and feeling like the reaction you got was your calculation like in Blood when you know exactly when shooting or throwing dynamite will be successful and impact.|@~~@|Awesome video. Really dig this kind of stuff.
Would like to see more. Keep it up.|@~~@|Winterfell  Rapture  Hyrule and Mushroom Kingdom??? Love the content. You explain things very well.|@~~@|i have published a few things... only made 50 bucks in 3 years.
But my motivation is internalized for life. I won't ever quit.|@~~@|This is the career path I've chosen to go down  even if I am only barely making minimum wage salary  I'll be over the moon. Being someone who's disposition is naturally cynical I would rather earn minimum wage working for myself than having a soul crushing job that possibly pays more.|@~~@|Thanks for the info  man. Just added all of your videos to my watch later playlist.|@~~@|Excellent video my friend 
thank you for such amazing motivation.|@~~@|I made this game called Jealous Bots and it took over six months all by myself. Even after releasing on both iOS and Android  I barely got more than 200 downloads and the game's quality is pretty up to date if you ask me. This is where I learnt how important marketing early on is  besides talking about your game with friends and family. Marketing only AFTER the game has been launched is way harder in my experience. I'll keep working hard though and learn from this for my next game. Cheers Devs!|@~~@|Useful tips  thanks!
Was nice to hear I’m one of the elite because I actually finished a game how I wanted it to be (of course I’m thinking of various ways I can continue to improve it too).
Best wishes to all the other Indie game creators out there!|@~~@|Thanks  I needed this kind of motivation!|@~~@|Hi Rick  could you please provide us with your portfolio of games made by yourself or you and your team? Thanks"

Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them!

This is the vision we have behind all of our courses 'Step by Step'
1. Start from scratch
2. Break down the topic
3. Simplify things
4. Go step by step

Teaching is my passion and I design every course so you can start from scratch, knowing nothing about a topic and become an expert after the course and can work on enterprise projects.

I am working as SDET III and DevOps in IT industry and having experience on many technologies.
Do not worry if you do not have any existing knowledge on the subject. We will go very basic, step by step.

I´ve learned more with this course than with some of paid ones on other sites! Thanks|@~~@|First of all  thank you for the video. One thing should be mentioned in upcoming courses.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher! I listen led to his Alison course and hoped to find a full version for AWS SAA. Thank you Sir |@~~@|Thanks for this great video. I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed! I found this course very illuminating. I especially liked the AWS Codestar and CI/CD pipelines guides. Thank you for sharing your deep understanding in these areas.|@~~@|Hey syed  Love your videos. Your explanation is from an architectural point of view.

I started studying for the solutions architect assiciate exam and I find a lot of things repeating from the previous exam. Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website. Do you offer hands on lab for the Associate or should I have my own aws login to do the labs ?|@~~@|Thanks so much. The explanation is very clear.

I am new to automation testing and just have switched from development to Automation Testing.....
I know my question might be stupid and baseless but as a fresher in Automation/SDET I always wonder about this as I want to continue growing in the automation field and which is what motivated me to switch from development....But this one question always keeps me down and bothers me a lot in my path....I dont know why but my developer friends always tell me ""You should be in development as the focus more now is shifting towards developer doing everything rather than having a separate qa automation sdet ....Developer also does some automation in some companies .....This is what my friends tell me and which bothers me a lot .....I igonre them But as a human having little experience in automation what is your take on this? I know this might be a stupid question that only a fresher can think of but my friends always warn me that future is more towards the developer doing everything and no separate tester will be required.....I 100 percent dont want this to be true as I love automation but one time I want to listen to your thoughts on this and clear my stupid doubt(even if this question pisses you off) You are my teacher so I ask you as a student the reality of this |@~~@|Hi Raghav

1. Moment
2. Marketing|@~~@|First 45 seconds were so true. It's so amazing creating games because you love to do it even if you don't get paid as much as you could. I can honestly say I'd rather be a one man team  create things I'm interested in and make less than work for a company  create whatever my boss tells me to and make more. It's all about the love for what you do.|@~~@|I'm a developer and I've been learning developing games for 2 months  I made a very simple game just to learn and will start making another  this time to get some return as well. Today I happened to come across some examples of indie games  and lost motivation for the first time in these 2 months. They look nothing like what I can create now or in the near-mid foreseeable future  they are amazing games and I surely can't compete with them  it's much harder than I thought  specially the animation and ""Moment"" part. I won't stop for now  I'm sinking with the ship!|@~~@|Thanks Rick! I'm currently developing an indie title and focusing on these 4 M's and how I'm going to do each of them really helped get me on track  even though it's on a super basic state.
Again  thanks for the help!|@~~@|motivation is the toughest part of the whole process for me  especially when working alone. additionally  the best part of the video hit the nail on the spot when you mentioned that you should not do everything by yourself if you're terrible at a certain part  such as game art.... the game may be awesome  but if it looks like stickmen walking around .... interest may wane....|@~~@|My favorite part of game-making is definitely working in the editor. Figuring out what mechanics I want  and then figuring out how to work them into the product is my favorite part  along with coding.

I love drawing  so concept art/game style is definitely something I can do myself.|@~~@|I’ll have to keep this in consideration when I start making indie games...currently on the road to become an indie developer with a degree in game development...not sure if I’ll go on my own or create some squad with other devs but ill see how it all goes when I get to that point  still a long way to go...I’m more into writing stories and narratives and lore and such though  that’s my talent|@~~@|Hey Rick  love your videos style. I'm heading in a good direction to getting my Kickstarter ready for the public  thanks for the advice. I'll try and stop by here when I have the time.|@~~@|I started to learn how to develop videogames in a Udemy course in which you were one of the teachers. Today  4 months later I have published my first mobile game  it has been a challenge  it is not amazing but I am extremely proud.|@~~@|1: I take this from old games and such. A single moment of just one place  a little platform or area. It's nothing and nothing happening but it feels so comfortable and sucks you in into the environment. Or the gameplay when you do an action and you get this awesome cool interaction that feel realistic cause you did it not a scripted segment and that's what makes a great core game solid. You must love to shoot and fire your guns  feel relief and calm when you find ammo or health when low on a specific gun or feel good and pleasure out of just firing your gun and feeling like the reaction you got was your calculation like in Blood when you know exactly when shooting or throwing dynamite will be successful and impact.|@~~@|Awesome video. Really dig this kind of stuff.
Would like to see more. Keep it up.|@~~@|Winterfell  Rapture  Hyrule and Mushroom Kingdom??? Love the content. You explain things very well.|@~~@|i have published a few things... only made 50 bucks in 3 years.
But my motivation is internalized for life. I won't ever quit.|@~~@|This is the career path I've chosen to go down  even if I am only barely making minimum wage salary  I'll be over the moon. Being someone who's disposition is naturally cynical I would rather earn minimum wage working for myself than having a soul crushing job that possibly pays more.|@~~@|Thanks for the info  man. Just added all of your videos to my watch later playlist.|@~~@|Excellent video my friend 
thank you for such amazing motivation.|@~~@|I made this game called Jealous Bots and it took over six months all by myself. Even after releasing on both iOS and Android  I barely got more than 200 downloads and the game's quality is pretty up to date if you ask me. This is where I learnt how important marketing early on is  besides talking about your game with friends and family. Marketing only AFTER the game has been launched is way harder in my experience. I'll keep working hard though and learn from this for my next game. Cheers Devs!|@~~@|Useful tips  thanks!
Was nice to hear I’m one of the elite because I actually finished a game how I wanted it to be (of course I’m thinking of various ways I can continue to improve it too).
Best wishes to all the other Indie game creators out there!|@~~@|Thanks  I needed this kind of motivation!|@~~@|Hi Rick  could you please provide us with your portfolio of games made by yourself or you and your team? Thanks"

Waiting to see what your next project with be. |@~~@|the project is very useful and accurate
thank you|@~~@|thank you so much!! brilliantly presented.|@~~@|i think it would be more practical if you could show how to control multiple pumps and read multiple sensors. also different plants have different moisture requirements so that would also need to be taken into account.|@~~@|Hey there  Can we use a small homemade battery powered water pump instead of the one you showed in the video?|@~~@|can this project be done using only a motor pump  resistor  soil moisture sensor and audino uno?|@~~@|hey idk why but i always get 76% humidity even when i did not put the sensor in the soil. is it normal?|@~~@|SO GOOD!!! you are my new hero|@~~@|I dont recommend that soil sensor  it corrodes super quickly. Capacitive soil sensor does not  get that instead|@~~@|Since this type of project requires Arduino to be powered on all the time   Is phone charger usb good power source for Arduino?
I never used phone charger for Arduino. Not sure if it will fry Arduino.|@~~@|how many to use sensor ? 1 sensor to 1 plant ?|@~~@|Useful projet.|@~~@|Was expecting to see it do the watering at the end of the video but was disappointed.

You are great teachers! Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them!

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.

Here I will be sharing my solutions to various computer programming challenges, exercises, and projects for C#, Java, Visual Basic, and C++.
The videos feature my own work and solutions.
Hopefully, watching me coming up with solutions to a variety of programming projects, from easy beginner stuff to more advanced programming projects, you will be able to compare your own solutions, or get unstuck with your own homework projects.

So don't forget to subscribe, as I release new programming videos often!

Subscribe to my channel and follow me",100,"Even an experienced developer in a specific field is a beginner in another field so the best thing that Angela is doing is that she focuses on clear and simple explanation with little samples to let us grasp the principal of the course. In a word she is the best teacher out there.|@~~@|I'm taking the course right now and so far  it's really good. I have zero experience in programming but Angela explains it clearly which makes it easier for me to follow.|@~~@|I'm taking the course with Dr.Angela on Udemy. The course really great. Even though I use English as my second language and I have a hard time to speak read and write  but she make the course easy to follow with clear explanation.  Just my opinion She is a the best professor for all developers. I highly recommended her course to everyone.|@~~@|I have both her course and web dev course from Colt Steele. To be honest Angela's course is great  however  she does cut off some basics on the earlier stage of HTML and CSS. For example  earlier on you spent time learning about tables and floats  which is hardly being used now. But she didn't touch about  CSS flex-box or CSS grid. Later when you jumped in framework such as Bootstrap  it was a bit fast  and I'm not against using frameworks  but you really need to have a strong understanding about how HTML and CSS works first  and then you can use frameworks to work faster (if you need it and don't mind the design it gives you). |@~~@|The CSS section is the best hands down. colt  andrei or jonas dont even come close. I used to always fear CSS especially things like display and position but now I feel totally comfortable.|@~~@|Really  she is a great tutor and she gives more informations and resources in this course. I learned a lot from this course.|@~~@|I have been enjoying her class immensely. I do wish I knew the front end and back end earlier. 
The thing that gives me anxiety is not knowing if I could impress potential employers when I finish this course. My intention of to apply for web development jobs when I finish all my Udemy courses.|@~~@|I stopped Angela course when I finished frontend sadly.
Actually she is the best teacher I ever met in my entire life.
She doesn't give you just the content  also she teach you how to walk and tell you how to run the field.
I tried to learn from other tutorials.|@~~@|I am looking for full stack developer course. Should I go with this one or is there any other better options also in udemy?|@~~@|I just bought her course. Can't wait to start!|@~~@|Best teacher ever period.|@~~@|As far as I know node.js is a   javascript runtime environment and not a programming language like you mentioned @4:13 and @4:17|@~~@|Thank you. Very helpful|@~~@|I  as a beginner who is looking to change career paths and has no experience at all like the fact that you are offering to be a mentor. I also wonder if the region that I am from plays a part in what is popular: ie react & ojs etc?|@~~@|Do you have anyone who does mentor programs for the Computer challenged ? I really liked your video on APP development but found it overwhelming.|@~~@|Angela's course are the best.. very inspring too|@~~@|I am a complete beginner who is interested in front developer path. Which course is best for me? Colt or Angela course?|@~~@|Your explanation of the cons do offer some different insights. I always get lost in Angela's voice|@~~@|Hi 
Which two courses you recommend to buy after this course?|@~~@|Can you do a video on Advanced courses Java Node Web.. for ex Colt Advanced web dev is very outdated"

I just decided to talk a bit more about everything Skip around and use the timestamps if needed.|@~~@|BEAST of a video! Heads up: 31:03 Adobe XD will likely be phased out this year  as Adobe bought Figma. I would not choose XD if you're starting out and are thinking about which UI software to start with. I'd go with Figma personally.|@~~@|For programmers  a new year is incomplete without watching Brad's classic guide on web development. When I watched the Web Development Practical Guide 2018 almost 5 years ago  I was just coding a “Guess My Number Game” on HTML and now I am watching 2023’s guide as a Full stack Dev with a YouTube channel documenting my progress. Thank you very much Brad Traversy and Congratulations on 2 Million subscribers! |@~~@|You are silent for months and we think you are getting your deserved rest  but you return with 3 hours guide tutorial  300 page ebook and a dedicated page with video tutorials following your guide. You are amazing Brad.|@~~@|When I was just starting to learn about the front end. Brad was the first content creator/teacher/mentor I connected with and started to understand things. The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes. Thank you Brad. Today I am a senior frontend developer thanks to the basics I learned with you. You are a hero.|@~~@|It's wild that this content just exists out here for free  thanks to Brad's commitment and hard work. You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!! So I wanted to say THANK YOU BRAD  it's always a pleasure to listen to you and in some way you make it so clear and calm me down and show me the way. You are the Jesus of tutorials |@~~@|Brad what you and the Traversy Media Team are doing for the community  you guys are gems  Can't thank you enough for everything you teach us|@~~@|Best 3 hours I have spent on Youtube  period! Most useful and concise video I have encountered in my software development learning journey. It puts everything in perspective and has given me a so much more complete overview of what is out there. Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable! It's hard to keep an overview when having been away from the web dev space for a while  and while some frameworks have been around for years  the landscape is constantly changing and there are just so many topics to keep track of. So thanks for this!|@~~@|The guide many developers have been waiting for.  This channel is a MUST for developers on YouTube.|@~~@|Another year and just like all the ones here in the past I have returned for the daily update! Already a seasoned full stack developer  but nonetheless these videos help me me determine course for the rest of the year. Thanks Brad for making this possible. |@~~@|I hope to land my first coding job this year.  Looking forward to watching this video for help.  Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.
Thank you very much  Brad!|@~~@|Every year i get further in these videos. Its easy to get overwhelmed in web dev  thanks to you i get a breakdown of everything and have a solid roadmap. thank you again this year Brad!"

Also  what about collection views and defining custom layouts? The thing is that every tutorial about SwiftUI is explaining the stackView and lists.|@~~@|Amazing. Thank you so much Brian.|@~~@|Great video  but I wanna know how to create the layout constrain for different iPhone? If I change the device to smaller like a real iPhone SE  it is simply over the view and only 3 rows were displayed  is there something as auto-layout like before to let it adopt for all iPhones?|@~~@|Спасибо за видео ️|@~~@|Hello Brian  Great tutorial man.Just wanted to ask you a little thing.With SwiftUI how we are going to deal with Auto Layout and Adaptive Layout?
Kindly must give answer to this because I hate AutoLayout.
Is SwiftUI will facilitate us or bring ease to ys in terms of AutoLayout?|@~~@|Thanks. Very clear  Very useful."

I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well. Thank you so much!|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir  ....u r always wonderful at your explanation...I m one of u  r student at Udemy .|@~~@|Thank you so much Rahul. This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.  Requesting you to modify the answer on video 26:41|@~~@|Thank You Rahul Sir that was amazing refreshing session. Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them!

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

I can honestly say I'd rather be a one man team  create things I'm interested in and make less than work for a company  create whatever my boss tells me to and make more. It's all about the love for what you do.|@~~@|I'm a developer and I've been learning developing games for 2 months  I made a very simple game just to learn and will start making another  this time to get some return as well. Today I happened to come across some examples of indie games  and lost motivation for the first time in these 2 months. They look nothing like what I can create now or in the near-mid foreseeable future  they are amazing games and I surely can't compete with them  it's much harder than I thought  specially the animation and ""Moment"" part. I won't stop for now  I'm sinking with the ship!|@~~@|Thanks Rick! I'm currently developing an indie title and focusing on these 4 M's and how I'm going to do each of them really helped get me on track  even though it's on a super basic state.
Again  thanks for the help!|@~~@|motivation is the toughest part of the whole process for me  especially when working alone. additionally  the best part of the video hit the nail on the spot when you mentioned that you should not do everything by yourself if you're terrible at a certain part  such as game art.... the game may be awesome  but if it looks like stickmen walking around .... interest may wane....|@~~@|My favorite part of game-making is definitely working in the editor. Figuring out what mechanics I want  and then figuring out how to work them into the product is my favorite part  along with coding.

I love drawing  so concept art/game style is definitely something I can do myself.|@~~@|I’ll have to keep this in consideration when I start making indie games...currently on the road to become an indie developer with a degree in game development...not sure if I’ll go on my own or create some squad with other devs but ill see how it all goes when I get to that point  still a long way to go...I’m more into writing stories and narratives and lore and such though  that’s my talent|@~~@|Hey Rick  love your videos style. I'm heading in a good direction to getting my Kickstarter ready for the public  thanks for the advice. I'll try and stop by here when I have the time.|@~~@|I started to learn how to develop videogames in a Udemy course in which you were one of the teachers. Today  4 months later I have published my first mobile game  it has been a challenge  it is not amazing but I am extremely proud.|@~~@|1: I take this from old games and such. A single moment of just one place  a little platform or area. It's nothing and nothing happening but it feels so comfortable and sucks you in into the environment. Or the gameplay when you do an action and you get this awesome cool interaction that feel realistic cause you did it not a scripted segment and that's what makes a great core game solid. You must love to shoot and fire your guns  feel relief and calm when you find ammo or health when low on a specific gun or feel good and pleasure out of just firing your gun and feeling like the reaction you got was your calculation like in Blood when you know exactly when shooting or throwing dynamite will be successful and impact.|@~~@|Awesome video. Really dig this kind of stuff.
Would like to see more. Keep it up.|@~~@|Winterfell  Rapture  Hyrule and Mushroom Kingdom??? Love the content. You explain things very well.|@~~@|i have published a few things... only made 50 bucks in 3 years.
But my motivation is internalized for life. I won't ever quit.|@~~@|This is the career path I've chosen to go down  even if I am only barely making minimum wage salary  I'll be over the moon. Being someone who's disposition is naturally cynical I would rather earn minimum wage working for myself than having a soul crushing job that possibly pays more.|@~~@|Thanks for the info  man. Just added all of your videos to my watch later playlist.|@~~@|Excellent video my friend 
thank you for such amazing motivation.|@~~@|I made this game called Jealous Bots and it took over six months all by myself. Even after releasing on both iOS and Android  I barely got more than 200 downloads and the game's quality is pretty up to date if you ask me. This is where I learnt how important marketing early on is  besides talking about your game with friends and family. Marketing only AFTER the game has been launched is way harder in my experience. I'll keep working hard though and learn from this for my next game. Cheers Devs!|@~~@|Useful tips  thanks!
Was nice to hear I’m one of the elite because I actually finished a game how I wanted it to be (of course I’m thinking of various ways I can continue to improve it too).
Best wishes to all the other Indie game creators out there!|@~~@|Thanks  I needed this kind of motivation!|@~~@|Hi Rick  could you please provide us with your portfolio of games made by yourself or you and your team? Thanks"

I don't have a possibility to learn coding with people  in groups  because I am from Ukraine. I have a job  but I don't go there as it is 'frozen' till unlimited. Fortunately  we got paid. Very little just to buy food and have Internet. 
I applied to Coursera and they allowed me a free course. I speak English  German  little Norvegian. Got the second education as an economist. But that all failed as the war started.

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(|@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer. There are still so many things need to learn in the Java platform. Do you have any plan to release any new videos/courses on Mockito  Microservice? It’s hard to find good content on those topics. I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

Thanks for sharing this wake up call for identity protection.|@~~@|I worked in a company for ten years suddenly they closed it. my life suddenly went dark... I am very professional in my work but i am totally outdated. i had to start from scratch to learn new technologies and its hard to restart yourself from zero again. most of the people failed and compromise with same old job because of their financial problems. so keep jumping from one point to another point  even water goes bad if it stays in one place.|@~~@|Love the video.  I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.  Couple of things though:  I'm still encapsulated in imposter syndrome when it comes to looking at different opportunities.  How do I ask for 6 figures while dealing with that.

Get in touch with me anytime if you have questions, suggestions, or want to collaborate.",337,"As you pointed out  maps became standard in Fantasy novels. I was a kid in the '70s and when a new book hit the shelves checking out the map in it was a big part of deciding whether to buy it. The deciding factors were just as you described. There was an art to it and blank space was important - something akin to Tolkien not fully explaining Tom Bombadil  letting us wonder. I remember looking at a book and rejecting it because the map was so filled in  so complete  and surely the story couldn't include all these places and if it did it was going to be tedious.|@~~@|In a weird way  this a perfect way to explain Tolkien's genius.... The story  the plots  the characters  the themes  the languages and lore  the rich world building...

He also created the arch type fanatasy map. He was ALSO badass at creating a fictional map.|@~~@|This map is so beautiful  I made it a centerpiece of the art in my library. I ordered the largest copy I could find  had it framed and it proudly takes up most of one wall in my library  surrounded by other  smaller works of art by cover artists I enjoy (including Tolkien artist Alan Lee).|@~~@|I love that you said it feels like Tolkien is just the first explorer and the person destined to share the stories written by Frodo  Bilbo and Sam (to a lesser degree) with us  maybe with the intention to show that despite all peril and evil forces against us there is hope and things we can do to influence the world for the better.|@~~@|I am so glad you mentioned _The Atlas of Middle Earth_.  There aren't enough people who know about this wonderful book  and reading the novel with this atlas open is an incredibly fun exercise.|@~~@|Morgoth raised the Misty Mountains to hinder Orome from roaming around freely. Sauron raised the mountains around Mordor as defence and for ""privacy"". 

It's such a marvelous map  It inspired me to make my own maps  although by using a program not by hand drawing.|@~~@|Always whenever I read the lord of the rings  I find myself keeping track of the adventures of the fellowship  whenever I had to close the book. Running my fingers over locations  rivers and mountain ranges; it makes you feel like a modest historian of middle earth. Long live Tolkien|@~~@|As a would-be author myself  having just as much trouble and fascination with fantastic cartography  it is reassuring to know that even the best fantasy author struggled with maps. Making maps is incredibly hard work.|@~~@|There is also ""The Journey's of Frodo"" by Barbara Strachey which is a cartographer's guide to Frodo and Companies journey. It is pretty interesting and shows the actual travel by Frodo and company. Where they were on the map during the story.|@~~@|I helped to embroider these maps onto a tablecloth for a friend's custom van around 1978. Only thing I ever sewed. It was a project for anyone who stopped in and it took weeks.|@~~@|I´ve drawn the third age map by hand and to scale and I can say that it is incredibly detailed. I´m starting to draw a map combinig 1st and second ages and maybe later I´ll draw even more Micro maps of areas like the Shire.

These maps are a treasure and I feel like they actually land the fantasy world on a ¨possible¨ and ¨tangible¨ manner. Almost as if you could study it.|@~~@|One thing that has differentiated you in this very moment from others who speak of the writings and the work artwork of JRR Tolkien  is that you have not only included Christopher in your mentions but you give them credit as the Tolkiens. They were indeed a team. Although j.r.r. started this and wrote the basics all of the history all of the details  it was Christopher it was Christopher who did as much work as his father.|@~~@|You have highlighted the two greatest strengths of Tolkien  along with the meaning and philosophy behind it- which is Tolkien's extensive attention to detail in a coherent picture of a world  and his soft  poetic inviting warmth  like a warm fire in a hobbit-hole by the side which stories are told.
Tolkien's maps have both of these qualities to a wonderful degree!|@~~@|2:29 As a kid in the 70s  this map was like a real world map to me. I used to just sit down and gaze at this map.|@~~@|One of my favorite details of these maps is Beleriand under the sea  hearkening back to medieval legends of the drowned realms of Ys and Lyonesse.|@~~@|As a lifelong enthusiast of both Tolkien's works and maps in general  I was always fascinated by the Sea of Rhun  which I always thought resembled the head of a lynx in shape.  I was mildly disappointed that no part of the story went to that region to reveal more information about it.|@~~@|I can't imagine the bizarre geologic events that would produce such a peculiar topology.|@~~@|I've been world-building and drawing maps of the places I've imagined for over 40 years of my life.  This map  created by Tolkien & Son was the template that started me.  Your video warms my heart and makes me feel a connection to Christopher  drawing these imagined worlds with pen on paper.|@~~@|What a superb video. So much information and a lovely measured pace and tone.
The examples of the maps from other books that could have influenced Tolkien  were simply fascinating.   That is proper first rate scholarship.  
I was surprised  but absolutely should not have been  to find out how much work and sweat went into the maps  and the degree of collaboration. |@~~@|13:22 That is a map of the 4th Division objectives on the Ancre front for the Battle of the Somme on July 1 1916. Except for one exception   none of the objectives were achieved and the Division was back where it started   minus 5800 casualties."

When I discovered Unreal Engine 4 I was blown away by it's realistic real-time rendering engine!  I immediately saw that Unreal Engine (UE4) was a game changer and that it had now become possible for a small studio consisting of a few artists to pull off a Hollywood quality feature length animated film! 

In the past it would take hours, if not days, to render each frame of an animation, which made it impossible for an independent artist to complete a full length film.  It would literally take years to render all the frames of a movie!

All this has changed with Unreal Engine 4 - the playing field has been leveled and it is now truly up to the talents and skill set of the artist/storyteller to create their vision.  No longer will you be held back due to limitations of technology.

I´ve learned more with this course than with some of paid ones on other sites! Thanks|@~~@|First of all  thank you for the video. One thing should be mentioned in upcoming courses.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher! I listen led to his Alison course and hoped to find a full version for AWS SAA. Thank you Sir |@~~@|Thanks for this great video. I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed! I found this course very illuminating. I especially liked the AWS Codestar and CI/CD pipelines guides. Thank you for sharing your deep understanding in these areas.|@~~@|Hey syed  Love your videos. Your explanation is from an architectural point of view. Just loving it.|@~~@|very good  and helpful explanation of different fault tolerant architectures it would be good if we get more videos and even on aws solutions  architect professional ml speciality aws certifications very understandable style of explanation for us students  planning to write exam soon|@~~@|Thank you so much for this course.  I was fearful of doing this on my own because I didn't know the best steps to initially take.|@~~@|I passed the Cloud Practioner exam and now I'm doing the Solutions Architect - this looks like a great place to start |@~~@|Thank you so much for the effort! Was really helpful. God bless you for the hardwork mate!|@~~@|Hey guys. Super-excited to share that I just finished this awesome course.  Thank you Syed and team.  On to the exam.|@~~@|Hey guys.  Super-excited to report that at 7:26:30 AWS has corrected 'Create a environment' to 'Create an environment'  so you don't need to check it yourselves.|@~~@|In this video we are getting high level details which function is used for the particular process  Can you suggest the videos to get the full details like how to create S3 VPC EC2 etc.|@~~@|Great explanation ! keep up the good work going !|@~~@|I just passed the exam. Thank you for this training. |@~~@|Very usefull video...full of comprehensive knowledge of aws components... newbee like me benefits a lot...ClayDesk - Thanks a ton|@~~@|Little part of it is old  but it still worth to watch  thanks a lot for this!|@~~@|I just passed the ccp exam last week. I started studying for the solutions architect assiciate exam and I find a lot of things repeating from the previous exam. Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website. Do you offer hands on lab for the Associate or should I have my own aws login to do the labs ?|@~~@|Thanks so much. The explanation is very clear.

In a word she is the best teacher out there.|@~~@|I'm taking the course right now and so far  it's really good. I have zero experience in programming but Angela explains it clearly which makes it easier for me to follow.|@~~@|I'm taking the course with Dr.Angela on Udemy. The course really great. Even though I use English as my second language and I have a hard time to speak read and write  but she make the course easy to follow with clear explanation.  Just my opinion She is a the best professor for all developers. I highly recommended her course to everyone.|@~~@|I have both her course and web dev course from Colt Steele. To be honest Angela's course is great  however  she does cut off some basics on the earlier stage of HTML and CSS. For example  earlier on you spent time learning about tables and floats  which is hardly being used now. But she didn't touch about  CSS flex-box or CSS grid. Later when you jumped in framework such as Bootstrap  it was a bit fast  and I'm not against using frameworks  but you really need to have a strong understanding about how HTML and CSS works first  and then you can use frameworks to work faster (if you need it and don't mind the design it gives you). |@~~@|The CSS section is the best hands down. colt  andrei or jonas dont even come close. I used to always fear CSS especially things like display and position but now I feel totally comfortable.|@~~@|Really  she is a great tutor and she gives more informations and resources in this course. I learned a lot from this course.|@~~@|I have been enjoying her class immensely. I do wish I knew the front end and back end earlier.

Tim's goal is to help you succeed in your journey to becoming a programmer.  His expertise is Java, C#, Kotlin, Python, Android app development, Spring, and more.  He will be publishing programming tutorials on these topics. But also, having been a programmer for over 35 years, he can probably give you a handle on questions you might have that are not tutorials.   Answers to questions like which programming language should you start with, or which career path should you follow.  Those types of things.

If you have a question add a comment to a video and if possible Tim will create a video on that topic and publish it on this channel.",35,"If you've got any questions or any topic that you would want me to discuss in an upcoming video  feel free to leave a comment below.

 I'm currently learning C on Jason Fedin's udemy course (from where i landed on this video).

When I watched the Web Development Practical Guide 2018 almost 5 years ago  I was just coding a “Guess My Number Game” on HTML and now I am watching 2023’s guide as a Full stack Dev with a YouTube channel documenting my progress. Thank you very much Brad Traversy and Congratulations on 2 Million subscribers! |@~~@|You are silent for months and we think you are getting your deserved rest  but you return with 3 hours guide tutorial  300 page ebook and a dedicated page with video tutorials following your guide. You are amazing Brad.|@~~@|When I was just starting to learn about the front end. Brad was the first content creator/teacher/mentor I connected with and started to understand things. The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes. Thank you Brad. Today I am a senior frontend developer thanks to the basics I learned with you. You are a hero.|@~~@|It's wild that this content just exists out here for free  thanks to Brad's commitment and hard work. You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!! So I wanted to say THANK YOU BRAD  it's always a pleasure to listen to you and in some way you make it so clear and calm me down and show me the way. You are the Jesus of tutorials |@~~@|Brad what you and the Traversy Media Team are doing for the community  you guys are gems  Can't thank you enough for everything you teach us|@~~@|Best 3 hours I have spent on Youtube  period! Most useful and concise video I have encountered in my software development learning journey. It puts everything in perspective and has given me a so much more complete overview of what is out there. Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable! It's hard to keep an overview when having been away from the web dev space for a while  and while some frameworks have been around for years  the landscape is constantly changing and there are just so many topics to keep track of. So thanks for this!|@~~@|The guide many developers have been waiting for.  This channel is a MUST for developers on YouTube.|@~~@|Another year and just like all the ones here in the past I have returned for the daily update! Already a seasoned full stack developer  but nonetheless these videos help me me determine course for the rest of the year. Thanks Brad for making this possible. |@~~@|I hope to land my first coding job this year.  Looking forward to watching this video for help.  Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.
Thank you very much  Brad!|@~~@|Every year i get further in these videos. Its easy to get overwhelmed in web dev  thanks to you i get a breakdown of everything and have a solid roadmap. thank you again this year Brad!"

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

First few questions itself were good enough to crack the interview and display confidence. Once again many thanks.|@~~@|00:42 Challenges
07:03 Authentication
8:28 API is the best form for automation
10:34 REST API|@~~@|Hi Rahul  
I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well. Thank you so much!|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir  ....u r always wonderful at your explanation...I m one of u  r student at Udemy .|@~~@|Thank you so much Rahul. This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.  Requesting you to modify the answer on video 26:41|@~~@|Thank You Rahul Sir that was amazing refreshing session. Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

Thank you very much! More power to your channel..|@~~@|I wouldn't neglect learning a solid amount of CS theory on the way.  It will change the way you analyze problems and implement solutions for the better!|@~~@|1. Define the goal  i.e. What set of skills?
2. Code every day
3. Don't waste time on problems you aren't making headway/are blocked on
4. Go to Meetups|@~~@|Great video.  I agree with everything except that you mentioned reading coding books isn't beneficial.  I agree that outdated material isn't that useful but if you find some good information in Book form it can be very beneficial.  

#10 is so good...  PREPARE FOR TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS!!!|@~~@|I’m glad you’re not a corporate simp who talks about “family” in the workplace.  Good video and straight to the point with practical advice.  You’re right  it’s all about being able to increase personal profit from gaining necessary knowledge.  No shame in sacking your current position at a company for a higher-paying position elsewhere.  Always shoot for the moon|@~~@|Thanks Dylan  appreciate the mention of my book! Great video as well. Agree with all you said here.|@~~@|11. Be motivated to learn. If your palms don’t sweat every time you think about getting a coding job you’re not motivated enough. Think about how a job like could better your life  and if you have a family  think about them and how much better their life would be if you ever get a job like that. THIS will push you to work harder on your skills and earn a role with pride. I’ve been at it for a year and I’m triple the developer that I was last year. Keep it up and never give up. You don’t have to be a mathematician to do it. All you need is:|@~~@|I recommend if you want to severely boost your programming skills is  to program data structures from scratch without looking up solution.      As well as search algorithms.  Preferably in c++ where memory management is not done for you.  Learn big o notation  and learn about algorithms and performance.   This will give you a very strong core to start off from compared to just learning random languages and not really knowing what you are doing."

Problems regarding the file size and type. Maybe in the next one you could be more specific on that. Another little issue is on the template you provided elementor pro user with  there are a few files which might be problematic  when I tried uploading them it shows ""type product does not exits.""|@~~@|Hi Darrel  I've noticed some online ecommerce stores have multiple tabs that provide additional information (Product Details  Shipping  etc.) in the Single Product Page. Is this an additional purchase of the WooCommerce extensions to get this option or is it just an option (in the free version of Woo) that needs to be turned on in the settings somewhere?|@~~@|The author is great  he explained everything in a clear and understandable way. I learned a lot of new things  thank you.️️️️️️️️️️️|@~~@|A big thank you!  I’m over 60 and not right click savvy and was able to make an e-commerce site by following your simple steps.

Well done and thank you for making this amazing video.|@~~@|Dear Darrel!

You are great teachers! Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them!

ABOUT ME

Teaching is my Passion and I made it as my profession from last 5 years. It gives me immense pleasure to share the knowledge I have gathered over several years. 
I figured out that, lots of students / professionals want to learn new technologies and improve their knowledge continuously. But due to lack of quality programs, this passion gets hampered. 
In-order to fill this gap, I have started ""Isha Training Solutions"", so as to understand the students and help them improve their knowledge. And by doing this, I have not only taken 100’s of Online and classroom sessions.

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best. What I love most about your tutorials is how you first raise questions  then present the traditional approach and the benefits of using Spring. You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.  Name age address part was pretty much easy... in the end  great tutorial to understand what is going on in the spring but for a begginer like me... I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all... I also understand that you had many things to cover in one single video so you can not go over basic details in it. Thanks :)|@~~@|Many thanks for this smooth and easily understandable tutorial Ranga. I wish you all the best for all your works.|@~~@|Hi Ranga i took your course on udemy  its really good but i have a problem that when i pass some section in course i forgot so many things about it im always getting back on it   and im not sure if i would be able to repeat that code without your videos|@~~@|Great educator!

You are great teachers! Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them!

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(|@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer. There are still so many things need to learn in the Java platform. Do you have any plan to release any new videos/courses on Mockito  Microservice? It’s hard to find good content on those topics. I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

I am very professional in my work but i am totally outdated. i had to start from scratch to learn new technologies and its hard to restart yourself from zero again. most of the people failed and compromise with same old job because of their financial problems. so keep jumping from one point to another point  even water goes bad if it stays in one place.|@~~@|Love the video.  I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.  Couple of things though:  I'm still encapsulated in imposter syndrome when it comes to looking at different opportunities.  How do I ask for 6 figures while dealing with that.  Secondly  where are those 6 figure jobs?  I'm in the Portland Oregon area and am not seeing much that I would qualify for with only 2 years.|@~~@|On this July 31 (within one month) I will complete two years in my current company and accidentally YouTube suggests me this video.

In a word she is the best teacher out there.|@~~@|I'm taking the course right now and so far  it's really good. I have zero experience in programming but Angela explains it clearly which makes it easier for me to follow.|@~~@|I'm taking the course with Dr.Angela on Udemy. The course really great. Even though I use English as my second language and I have a hard time to speak read and write  but she make the course easy to follow with clear explanation.  Just my opinion She is a the best professor for all developers. I highly recommended her course to everyone.|@~~@|I have both her course and web dev course from Colt Steele. To be honest Angela's course is great  however  she does cut off some basics on the earlier stage of HTML and CSS. For example  earlier on you spent time learning about tables and floats  which is hardly being used now. But she didn't touch about  CSS flex-box or CSS grid. Later when you jumped in framework such as Bootstrap  it was a bit fast  and I'm not against using frameworks  but you really need to have a strong understanding about how HTML and CSS works first  and then you can use frameworks to work faster (if you need it and don't mind the design it gives you). |@~~@|The CSS section is the best hands down. colt  andrei or jonas dont even come close. I used to always fear CSS especially things like display and position but now I feel totally comfortable.|@~~@|Really  she is a great tutor and she gives more informations and resources in this course. I learned a lot from this course.|@~~@|I have been enjoying her class immensely. I do wish I knew the front end and back end earlier. 
The thing that gives me anxiety is not knowing if I could impress potential employers when I finish this course. My intention of to apply for web development jobs when I finish all my Udemy courses.|@~~@|I stopped Angela course when I finished frontend sadly.
Actually she is the best teacher I ever met in my entire life.
She doesn't give you just the content  also she teach you how to walk and tell you how to run the field.
I tried to learn from other tutorials.|@~~@|I am looking for full stack developer course. Should I go with this one or is there any other better options also in udemy?|@~~@|I just bought her course. Can't wait to start!|@~~@|Best teacher ever period.|@~~@|As far as I know node.js is a   javascript runtime environment and not a programming language like you mentioned @4:13 and @4:17|@~~@|Thank you. Very helpful|@~~@|I  as a beginner who is looking to change career paths and has no experience at all like the fact that you are offering to be a mentor. I also wonder if the region that I am from plays a part in what is popular: ie react & ojs etc?|@~~@|Do you have anyone who does mentor programs for the Computer challenged ? I really liked your video on APP development but found it overwhelming.|@~~@|Angela's course are the best.. very inspring too|@~~@|I am a complete beginner who is interested in front developer path. Which course is best for me? Colt or Angela course?|@~~@|Your explanation of the cons do offer some different insights. I always get lost in Angela's voice|@~~@|Hi 
Which two courses you recommend to buy after this course?|@~~@|Can you do a video on Advanced courses Java Node Web.. for ex Colt Advanced web dev is very outdated"

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(|@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer. There are still so many things need to learn in the Java platform. Do you have any plan to release any new videos/courses on Mockito  Microservice? It’s hard to find good content on those topics. I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

Thanks for sharing this wake up call for identity protection.|@~~@|I worked in a company for ten years suddenly they closed it. my life suddenly went dark... I am very professional in my work but i am totally outdated. i had to start from scratch to learn new technologies and its hard to restart yourself from zero again. most of the people failed and compromise with same old job because of their financial problems. so keep jumping from one point to another point  even water goes bad if it stays in one place.|@~~@|Love the video.  I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.  Couple of things though:  I'm still encapsulated in imposter syndrome when it comes to looking at different opportunities.  How do I ask for 6 figures while dealing with that.  Secondly  where are those 6 figure jobs?  I'm in the Portland Oregon area and am not seeing much that I would qualify for with only 2 years.|@~~@|On this July 31 (within one month) I will complete two years in my current company and accidentally YouTube suggests me this video. How lucky am I !! Really helpful video ️|@~~@|Perfect time for this video. I've been working in my first job for over 2 5 years.|@~~@|You're right Ahmad  if you dont have any more things to learn  it's better to change.
But what do you think about changing in this pandemic time? Is it a good idea? What do you think?|@~~@|Thank you so much sir for  your advice. waiting for lesson 11 and on...
you are doing great work by spreading knowledge...|@~~@|you are 100% correct about the identity. I havejust completed 2 years at my company as an entry lvl data analyst and they still view me as a junior  it is very true that your bosses won't let you come up and give you a raise because they still view you us a jr.
Time to lvl up!!!|@~~@|A collegue of mine told me the exact same about the salery. They wont increase your salery big time because then they need to do that for everyone. They would risk the few that leaves|@~~@|Woow  i got a new job after 11 years on my first tech company! I can't really belive that this video was released when i was searching if i should move on or not. Now on this new IT company working almost 3 month i will say that all he talks in the video is TRUE! And most important guys & girls  the Identity. Its all on you what you want people to know about you in your next work.|@~~@|Hi Imtiaz i want to learn python for data science and machine learning  i have taken a few courses on udemy and coursera  but i mainly find them too superficial and not in enough depth  any suggestions? or is something related coming on job ready programmer  soon ? :)|@~~@|3 years i had 4-5 jobs.

You are great teachers! Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them! Really nice work  i think i am going to take the full course !|@~~@|Great work! I enjoyed it even though in some points I struggled to follow all the steps due to tons of visual and audible information XD.

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches.

Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.

Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best.

You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.

I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all...

I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations.

This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.  Requesting you to modify the answer on video 26:41|@~~@|Thank You Rahul Sir that was amazing refreshing session. Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

#10 is so good...  PREPARE FOR TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS!!!|@~~@|I’m glad you’re not a corporate simp who talks about “family” in the workplace.  Good video and straight to the point with practical advice.  You’re right  it’s all about being able to increase personal profit from gaining necessary knowledge.  No shame in sacking your current position at a company for a higher-paying position elsewhere.  Always shoot for the moon|@~~@|Thanks Dylan  appreciate the mention of my book! Great video as well. Agree with all you said here.|@~~@|11. Be motivated to learn. If your palms don’t sweat every time you think about getting a coding job you’re not motivated enough. Think about how a job like could better your life  and if you have a family  think about them and how much better their life would be if you ever get a job like that. THIS will push you to work harder on your skills and earn a role with pride. I’ve been at it for a year and I’m triple the developer that I was last year. Keep it up and never give up. You don’t have to be a mathematician to do it. All you need is:|@~~@|I recommend if you want to severely boost your programming skills is  to program data structures from scratch without looking up solution.      As well as search algorithms.  Preferably in c++ where memory management is not done for you.  Learn big o notation  and learn about algorithms and performance.   This will give you a very strong core to start off from compared to just learning random languages and not really knowing what you are doing."

First few questions itself were good enough to crack the interview and display confidence. Once again many thanks.|@~~@|00:42 Challenges
07:03 Authentication
8:28 API is the best form for automation
10:34 REST API|@~~@|Hi Rahul  
I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well. Thank you so much!|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir  ....u r always wonderful at your explanation...I m one of u  r student at Udemy .|@~~@|Thank you so much Rahul. This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.  Requesting you to modify the answer on video 26:41|@~~@|Thank You Rahul Sir that was amazing refreshing session. Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

Most of my activities have been focussed around growing the GameDev.tv community (www.gamedev.tv) and creating courses to teach folks how to become a game developer. ,153,"The 4 M's of Success

1. Moment
2. Marketing|@~~@|First 45 seconds were so true. It's so amazing creating games because you love to do it even if you don't get paid as much as you could. I can honestly say I'd rather be a one man team  create things I'm interested in and make less than work for a company  create whatever my boss tells me to and make more. It's all about the love for what you do.|@~~@|I'm a developer and I've been learning developing games for 2 months  I made a very simple game just to learn and will start making another  this time to get some return as well. Today I happened to come across some examples of indie games  and lost motivation for the first time in these 2 months. They look nothing like what I can create now or in the near-mid foreseeable future  they are amazing games and I surely can't compete with them  it's much harder than I thought  specially the animation and ""Moment"" part. I won't stop for now  I'm sinking with the ship!|@~~@|Thanks Rick! I'm currently developing an indie title and focusing on these 4 M's and how I'm going to do each of them really helped get me on track  even though it's on a super basic state.
Again  thanks for the help!|@~~@|motivation is the toughest part of the whole process for me  especially when working alone. additionally  the best part of the video hit the nail on the spot when you mentioned that you should not do everything by yourself if you're terrible at a certain part  such as game art.... the game may be awesome  but if it looks like stickmen walking around .... interest may wane....|@~~@|My favorite part of game-making is definitely working in the editor. Figuring out what mechanics I want  and then figuring out how to work them into the product is my favorite part  along with coding.

I love drawing  so concept art/game style is definitely something I can do myself.|@~~@|I’ll have to keep this in consideration when I start making indie games...currently on the road to become an indie developer with a degree in game development...not sure if I’ll go on my own or create some squad with other devs but ill see how it all goes when I get to that point  still a long way to go...I’m more into writing stories and narratives and lore and such though  that’s my talent|@~~@|Hey Rick  love your videos style. I'm heading in a good direction to getting my Kickstarter ready for the public  thanks for the advice. I'll try and stop by here when I have the time.|@~~@|I started to learn how to develop videogames in a Udemy course in which you were one of the teachers. Today  4 months later I have published my first mobile game  it has been a challenge  it is not amazing but I am extremely proud.|@~~@|1: I take this from old games and such. A single moment of just one place  a little platform or area. It's nothing and nothing happening but it feels so comfortable and sucks you in into the environment. Or the gameplay when you do an action and you get this awesome cool interaction that feel realistic cause you did it not a scripted segment and that's what makes a great core game solid. You must love to shoot and fire your guns  feel relief and calm when you find ammo or health when low on a specific gun or feel good and pleasure out of just firing your gun and feeling like the reaction you got was your calculation like in Blood when you know exactly when shooting or throwing dynamite will be successful and impact.|@~~@|Awesome video. Really dig this kind of stuff.
Would like to see more. Keep it up.|@~~@|Winterfell  Rapture  Hyrule and Mushroom Kingdom??? Love the content. You explain things very well.|@~~@|i have published a few things... only made 50 bucks in 3 years.
But my motivation is internalized for life. I won't ever quit.|@~~@|This is the career path I've chosen to go down  even if I am only barely making minimum wage salary  I'll be over the moon. Being someone who's disposition is naturally cynical I would rather earn minimum wage working for myself than having a soul crushing job that possibly pays more.|@~~@|Thanks for the info  man. Just added all of your videos to my watch later playlist.|@~~@|Excellent video my friend 
thank you for such amazing motivation.|@~~@|I made this game called Jealous Bots and it took over six months all by myself. Even after releasing on both iOS and Android  I barely got more than 200 downloads and the game's quality is pretty up to date if you ask me. This is where I learnt how important marketing early on is  besides talking about your game with friends and family. Marketing only AFTER the game has been launched is way harder in my experience. I'll keep working hard though and learn from this for my next game. Cheers Devs!|@~~@|Useful tips  thanks!
Was nice to hear I’m one of the elite because I actually finished a game how I wanted it to be (of course I’m thinking of various ways I can continue to improve it too).

I love all your work and I am thrilled you have done a lesson on GPT!  MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(|@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer.

I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher!

It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed!

Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website.

I applied to Coursera and they allowed me a free course. I speak English  German  little Norvegian. Got the second education as an economist. But that all failed as the war started. I say all of that  because it is just hard to study alone. I used to be a teacher in the university in my younger years. I had great memory and it was so easy to master anything. Now it is hard.

I wanna do a Paper Mario inspired game and this was the better and most effective tutorial i could find. Thank you for you help.|@~~@|2 questions 1 is there a way to rotate the camera around the player 360 and 2 is it possible moving the character on through the depth z if he still keeps his normal x and y platform movement|@~~@|This is really cool! But do you have advice on how you would make the 2.5D camera have some natural drift  so that it is not locked onto the player character? I'd like the camera to have to ""catch up"" to the player slightly. Thanks for your time. Cheers.|@~~@|I'm struggling with something. I wanted to use this script for props for a top down game.

There would be a way for you to do a course or some tutorials to create a farm simulator  like Stardew Valley|@~~@|Can you make a tutorial like this for top down 3D?|@~~@|I seem to be having a problem where the top face isn't displaying where the collision for the wall actually is  I've poked around for a solution and can't find one. any help?|@~~@|Hi

In a word she is the best teacher out there.|@~~@|I'm taking the course right now and so far  it's really good. I have zero experience in programming but Angela explains it clearly which makes it easier for me to follow.|@~~@|I'm taking the course with Dr.Angela on Udemy. The course really great. Even though I use English as my second language and I have a hard time to speak read and write  but she make the course easy to follow with clear explanation.  Just my opinion She is a the best professor for all developers. I highly recommended her course to everyone.|@~~@|I have both her course and web dev course from Colt Steele. To be honest Angela's course is great  however  she does cut off some basics on the earlier stage of HTML and CSS. For example  earlier on you spent time learning about tables and floats  which is hardly being used now. But she didn't touch about  CSS flex-box or CSS grid. Later when you jumped in framework such as Bootstrap  it was a bit fast  and I'm not against using frameworks  but you really need to have a strong understanding about how HTML and CSS works first  and then you can use frameworks to work faster (if you need it and don't mind the design it gives you). |@~~@|The CSS section is the best hands down. colt  andrei or jonas dont even come close. I used to always fear CSS especially things like display and position but now I feel totally comfortable.


currently in HTML/CSS section hope the remaining sections wil also be great as the first sections|@~~@|Really  she is a great tutor and she gives more informations and resources in this course. I learned a lot from this course.|@~~@|I have been enjoying her class immensely. I do wish I knew the front end and back end earlier. 
The thing that gives me anxiety is not knowing if I could impress potential employers when I finish this course. My intention of to apply for web development jobs when I finish all my Udemy courses.|@~~@|I stopped Angela course when I finished frontend sadly.
Actually she is the best teacher I ever met in my entire life.
She doesn't give you just the content  also she teach you how to walk and tell you how to run the field.
I tried to learn from other tutorials.|@~~@|I am looking for full stack developer course. Should I go with this one or is there any other better options also in udemy?|@~~@|I just bought her course. Can't wait to start!|@~~@|Best teacher ever period.|@~~@|As far as I know node.js is a   javascript runtime environment and not a programming language like you mentioned @4:13 and @4:17|@~~@|Thank you. Very helpful|@~~@|I  as a beginner who is looking to change career paths and has no experience at all like the fact that you are offering to be a mentor.

I really liked your video on APP development but found it overwhelming.|@~~@|Angela's course are the best.. very inspring too|@~~@|I am a complete beginner who is interested in front developer path. Which course is best for me? Colt or Angela course?|@~~@|Your explanation of the cons do offer some different insights. I always get lost in Angela's voice|@~~@|Hi 
Which two courses you recommend to buy after this course?|@~~@|Can you do a video on Advanced courses Java Node Web.. for ex Colt Advanced web dev is very outdated"

When I discovered Unreal Engine 4 I was blown away by it's realistic real-time rendering engine!  I immediately saw that Unreal Engine (UE4) was a game changer and that it had now become possible for a small studio consisting of a few artists to pull off a Hollywood quality feature length animated film! 

In the past it would take hours, if not days, to render each frame of an animation, which made it impossible for an independent artist to complete a full length film.  It would literally take years to render all the frames of a movie!

All this has changed with Unreal Engine 4 - the playing field has been leveled and it is now truly up to the talents and skill set of the artist/storyteller to create their vision.  No longer will you be held back due to limitations of technology.  

Join with me as we begin a journey in using this awesome tool-set!",25,"For more information on my Unreal Engine courses:https://michael-ricks-unreal-engine-4-training.newzenler.com/courses/the-super-mega-combo-pack?coupon=YOUTUBEAD|@~~@|I found you on Skillshare.

Learning theme builder was a value addition for me indeed.|@~~@|I actually can't thank you enough for the time you have put into this  as well as your other videos.

Problems regarding the file size and type. Maybe in the next one you could be more specific on that. Another little issue is on the template you provided elementor pro user with  there are a few files which might be problematic  when I tried uploading them it shows ""type product does not exits.""|@~~@|Hi Darrel  I've noticed some online ecommerce stores have multiple tabs that provide additional information (Product Details  Shipping  etc.) in the Single Product Page. Is this an additional purchase of the WooCommerce extensions to get this option or is it just an option (in the free version of Woo) that needs to be turned on in the settings somewhere?|@~~@|The author is great  he explained everything in a clear and understandable way.

The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches.

Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.

Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation.

The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them!

My question is where does JAVA  KOTLIN  GOLAND  C#  C++ etc...fit? |@~~@|How do I  send you a picture of a section of code that I may ask another question about. It is about syntax and spacing.

High quality tutorials that are fun, educational, and easy to follow.  Teaching programming is my passion!  I find joy in making complex material easy to understand.

I've decided that it is only right to upload videos of great quality and value.  Here you will find videos on C++, JavaScript, C, database design, SQL, and more!  As a side note, many videos contain horribly cheesy jokes and random stories...you've been warned.

I don't have a possibility to learn coding with people  in groups  because I am from Ukraine. I have a job  but I don't go there as it is 'frozen' till unlimited. Fortunately  we got paid. Very little just to buy food and have Internet. 
I applied to Coursera and they allowed me a free course. I speak English  German  little Norvegian. Got the second education as an economist. But that all failed as the war started. I say all of that  because it is just hard to study alone. I used to be a teacher in the university in my younger years. I had great memory and it was so easy to master anything. Now it is hard.

I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well.

This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.

Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

When I watched the Web Development Practical Guide 2018 almost 5 years ago  I was just coding a “Guess My Number Game” on HTML and now I am watching 2023’s guide as a Full stack Dev with a YouTube channel documenting my progress. Thank you very much Brad Traversy and Congratulations on 2 Million subscribers! |@~~@|You are silent for months and we think you are getting your deserved rest  but you return with 3 hours guide tutorial  300 page ebook and a dedicated page with video tutorials following your guide. You are amazing Brad.|@~~@|When I was just starting to learn about the front end. Brad was the first content creator/teacher/mentor I connected with and started to understand things. The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes. Thank you Brad. Today I am a senior frontend developer thanks to the basics I learned with you. You are a hero.|@~~@|It's wild that this content just exists out here for free  thanks to Brad's commitment and hard work. You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!!

Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable! It's hard to keep an overview when having been away from the web dev space for a while  and while some frameworks have been around for years  the landscape is constantly changing and there are just so many topics to keep track of. So thanks for this!|@~~@|The guide many developers have been waiting for.  This channel is a MUST for developers on YouTube.|@~~@|Another year and just like all the ones here in the past I have returned for the daily update! Already a seasoned full stack developer  but nonetheless these videos help me me determine course for the rest of the year.

Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.

Thank you for making this content free for all to learn and cheers to your journey on growing your Youtube channel ;)|@~~@|Hey  no hate here just wanted to point out a couple of things. The first is that this probably the best educational video I have ever seen from the realm of IT  just because of its length (amount of content). However  I can't help but notice the different approach of the moderators. The first one is taking things step-by-step  explaining everything for example even the little things like <h1>. It is in my opinion this depth of explanation that separates great tutorials from mediocre ones. The second guy on the other hand  was going too fast in my opinion  and isn't bothered with explaining at all. Also the second guy left the previous guy's code and didn't expand on it  which just led to unnecessary confusion.|@~~@|Really nice tutorial  i really love that you go into details and explain them! Really nice work  i think i am going to take the full course !|@~~@|Great work!

আমি ২০১২ সাল থেকে ফ্রিলেন্সিং করছি। এই সময়ে প্রতি দিন আমি কাজ করার পাশাপাশি নতুন জিনিশ শিখেছি। একজন বাঙ্গালি হয়ে আমার জন্য একা কাজ শিখা অনেক কঠিন ছিলো। যেই রিসোর্স পেয়েছি সেখানে কিছু না কিছু বাদ গিয়েছে। ফলে একটা সমস্যা সমাধানে আমাকে কয়েকটা রিসোর্স চেক করতে হয়েছে। আমার চ্যানেলে আমি চেষ্টা করবো ব্যাসিক থেকে এডভান্স সব বিস্তারিত ভাবে আলোচনা করতে। 

🟥 আমার কোন পেইড কোর্স নেই বা কোন কোচিং সেন্টার ও নেই। তাই কেউ এই ব্যাপারে বললে সাবধান হবেন। 

তাই আপনি যদি সত্যি ভালোভাবে শিখতে চান তবে সাবস্ক্রাইব করে পাশে থাকুন।

I´ve learned more with this course than with some of paid ones on other sites! Thanks|@~~@|First of all  thank you for the video. One thing should be mentioned in upcoming courses.

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher! I listen led to his Alison course and hoped to find a full version for AWS SAA. Thank you Sir |@~~@|Thanks for this great video. I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed! I found this course very illuminating. I especially liked the AWS Codestar and CI/CD pipelines guides. Thank you for sharing your deep understanding in these areas.|@~~@|Hey syed  Love your videos.

I started studying for the solutions architect assiciate exam and I find a lot of things repeating from the previous exam. Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material? And I am going to watch your whole course anyway  it is great.|@~~@|Hi Syed - I was looking at your website. Do you offer hands on lab for the Associate or should I have my own aws login to do the labs ?|@~~@|Thanks so much. The explanation is very clear.

The tutorial kept me captivated  and I thoroughly enjoyed the way you taught. I've always had difficulty understanding some parts of the Spring Framework  but this tutorial is by far the best. What I love most about your tutorials is how you first raise questions  then present the traditional approach and the benefits of using Spring. You then address the raised questions and reinforce the concepts with additional examples. Brilliant!|@~~@|It's a great course..
Best 2 hrs of the day.

Thanks Ranga!|@~~@|i have been hearing about spring and spring boot and I don't know how to get started with it  but with this 1 hour introduction section of just the spring framework itself  getting started with the course is a must. i now understand why most companies are looking for spring developers. coupling of component without data leakages make this framework interesting and exciting to work it  especially autowiring. it seems confusing at first  but with understanding of polymorphism in OOP  it makes things easy to grab. thanks for this..|@~~@|I wish mentors like you grow and make greater contributions for this community|@~~@|I am absolute beginner in java and java spring  so I will say that in gamerunner It was hard for me to catch up.  Name age address part was pretty much easy... in the end  great tutorial to understand what is going on in the spring but for a begginer like me... I was thrown off the loop multiple times  may be because I was having hard time to understand the flow of project... like what is happening and what method is calling what right now and all... I also understand that you had many things to cover in one single video so you can not go over basic details in it.

could you suggest me the name of course which one should i do next to learn about spring and spring framework?|@~~@|very helpful for them.. who are tired of learning spring|@~~@|A suggestion  try to make examples a bit more structured as you go into complex example. Stop using ""01"" or""02"" in class names and  names like ""Hello World"" with methods  making it more ambiguous. I understand that this is a beginner course but Spring it self is an advance topic.

Thank you very much Brad Traversy and Congratulations on 2 Million subscribers! |@~~@|You are silent for months and we think you are getting your deserved rest  but you return with 3 hours guide tutorial  300 page ebook and a dedicated page with video tutorials following your guide. You are amazing Brad.|@~~@|When I was just starting to learn about the front end. Brad was the first content creator/teacher/mentor I connected with and started to understand things. The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes. Thank you Brad. Today I am a senior frontend developer thanks to the basics I learned with you. You are a hero.|@~~@|It's wild that this content just exists out here for free  thanks to Brad's commitment and hard work. You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!!

Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable!

Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(
Please keep giving us advice. |@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer. There are still so many things need to learn in the Java platform. Do you have any plan to release any new videos/courses on Mockito  Microservice? It’s hard to find good content on those topics. I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

Thanks for sharing this wake up call for identity protection.|@~~@|I worked in a company for ten years suddenly they closed it. my life suddenly went dark... I am very professional in my work but i am totally outdated. i had to start from scratch to learn new technologies and its hard to restart yourself from zero again. most of the people failed and compromise with same old job because of their financial problems. so keep jumping from one point to another point  even water goes bad if it stays in one place.|@~~@|Love the video.  I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.  Couple of things though:  I'm still encapsulated in imposter syndrome when it comes to looking at different opportunities.  How do I ask for 6 figures while dealing with that.  Secondly  where are those 6 figure jobs?  I'm in the Portland Oregon area and am not seeing much that I would qualify for with only 2 years.|@~~@|On this July 31 (within one month) I will complete two years in my current company and accidentally YouTube suggests me this video. How lucky am I !! Really helpful video ️|@~~@|Perfect time for this video. I've been working in my first job for over 2 5 years.|@~~@|You're right Ahmad  if you dont have any more things to learn  it's better to change.
But what do you think about changing in this pandemic time? Is it a good idea? What do you think?|@~~@|Thank you so much sir for  your advice. waiting for lesson 11 and on...
you are doing great work by spreading knowledge...|@~~@|you are 100% correct about the identity. I havejust completed 2 years at my company as an entry lvl data analyst and they still view me as a junior  it is very true that your bosses won't let you come up and give you a raise because they still view you us a jr.
Time to lvl up!!!|@~~@|A collegue of mine told me the exact same about the salery. They wont increase your salery big time because then they need to do that for everyone. They would risk the few that leaves|@~~@|Woow  i got a new job after 11 years on my first tech company! I can't really belive that this video was released when i was searching if i should move on or not. Now on this new IT company working almost 3 month i will say that all he talks in the video is TRUE! And most important guys & girls  the Identity. Its all on you what you want people to know about you in your next work.|@~~@|Hi Imtiaz i want to learn python for data science and machine learning  i have taken a few courses on udemy and coursera  but i mainly find them too superficial and not in enough depth  any suggestions? or is something related coming on job ready programmer  soon ? :)|@~~@|3 years i had 4-5 jobs. Not a software developer but still it's cool to have experienced 2 foreign countries and work in different environment... |@~~@|I'm a data analyst and I have learnt SQL using your course and want to start my career as a SQL Developer.  Do you recommend finding a junior level job first even though the pay might be lower than my current role?Thanks|@~~@|I wish I had seen this or got some advice like this when I was a fresher. I ended up staying 8 years in the same company |@~~@|Agreed... Switching is easy way to grow early in your career|@~~@|Thank a lot @Ahmad your advice is helping me to grow in software development  though am still learning am into JSVAFX framework now.|@~~@|I have been with the current employer from the last 8 years :( .

07:03 Authentication
8:28 API is the best form for automation
10:34 REST API|@~~@|Hi Rahul  
I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well.

This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.  Requesting you to modify the answer on video 26:41|@~~@|Thank You Rahul Sir that was amazing refreshing session. Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

https://backend.husseinnasser.com|@~~@|This series of ""Devtool them all"" is pretty interesting  good job man  making a technical subject very interesting|@~~@|I'm in my first year of working in a tech based company as a full stack dev... the amount of knowledge that I am learning every single day astounds me!  When you think you know something  it turns out you are just scratching the surface when learning development. Thanks for the video! Watching this video opened my eyes to technology that I have never heard before in my entire life.|@~~@|Netflix uses HTTP/1.1 because as you said  it can be process intensive  but also can lead to worse experience for older hardware or devices  as it may be more memory and compute insensitive on both client and server.

Netflix's routing is a marvel. Considering they use HTTP/1.1 they still are able to squeeze a lot of performance and relatively low load times  considering the content they deliver.|@~~@|15:00 nginx doesn't have QUIC / HTTP/3 yet  as of a month ago nginx-quic is being merged into mainline and still isn't out yet. I'm sure netflix is waiting for that and waiting for it to be polished and experimenting in the meantime.
Also with http/1.1 and multiple server / client load balancing  they can open as many requests as they want.. 6 per server  that is why you saw no white bars.
The thumbnails on the bar that save in memory are every 10 seconds because they're just the keyframe.. frames  which are every 10 seconds by default in most encoding|@~~@|This is absolutely fantastic! The amount of information is mind blowing! Thanks for doing this  you really got me hooked ;)|@~~@|I find client side load balancing and downloading all thumbnails into memory interesting|@~~@|I've just started learning back-end developement and your tips on optimization and security are pretty cool and useful|@~~@|That's once again a great video by Mr. Nasser. Netflix has a much better web app than almost all of it's competitors  and it's pretty interesting to know the technical decisions they make|@~~@|I love this series! Maybe you can do something similar for viewer submissions as well in the future?|@~~@|Found your channel from Mental Outlaw's Youtube suggestions  So glad I did because this is the kind of content I have been dying to find. Signed up for your NGINX udemy course (couldn't catch the python backend course sale in time though) and subbed. Excited to see more from you!|@~~@|LOVE watching these videos  super entertaining  and they make me feel like I actually know something!|@~~@|these always stretch my thinking. In the past  I would've been more judgmental about so many requests on the same domain on http 1.1  but I'm sure the decision to switch is more nuanced than I understand.|@~~@|Everytime I watch your video  I feel like  I need to learn a lot  which excites me to continue watching more and more. Can binge watch the whole devtooling |@~~@|I have learned a lot in this dev tooling session. Very interesting!|@~~@|Very interesting to see what is going on behind the scenes! Great series!! |@~~@|Netflix‘s main infrastructure is on AWS  however many of the streaming servers are outside of the cloud and near local internet service providers to decrease latency for users and save bandwidth costs.|@~~@|Absolutely love this series|@~~@|Client side loadbalancing is definitely interesting  but makes perfect sense for video streaming
Server-side loadbalancing is great  as it's able to spread the cpu load across servers  but for video streaming the bottleneck is not CPU but bandwidth
So If you had a server-side loadbalancer it woud be incredibly hard to have any one or even multiple that's able to handle the bandwidth|@~~@|I store all the preview thumbnails in one sprite and just display a section. Youtube does this too but stores it in multiple sprites.
I know you don't want to risk and deal with it  but this classifies as fair use for research purposes "

MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional. It ""hears"" the best from the front side where there 'Rode' label is and it will pick up less of the room tone that way.|@~~@|Great video  Ryan. Thank you |@~~@|Hey Prof. Ryan.

ABOUT ME

Teaching is my Passion and I made it as my profession from last 5 years. It gives me immense pleasure to share the knowledge I have gathered over several years. 
I figured out that, lots of students / professionals want to learn new technologies and improve their knowledge continuously. But due to lack of quality programs, this passion gets hampered. 
In-order to fill this gap, I have started ""Isha Training Solutions"", so as to understand the students and help them improve their knowledge. And by doing this, I have not only taken 100’s of Online and classroom sessions.

https://backend.husseinnasser.com|@~~@|This series of ""Devtool them all"" is pretty interesting  good job man  making a technical subject very interesting|@~~@|I'm in my first year of working in a tech based company as a full stack dev... the amount of knowledge that I am learning every single day astounds me!  When you think you know something  it turns out you are just scratching the surface when learning development. Thanks for the video! Watching this video opened my eyes to technology that I have never heard before in my entire life.|@~~@|Netflix uses HTTP/1.1 because as you said  it can be process intensive  but also can lead to worse experience for older hardware or devices  as it may be more memory and compute insensitive on both client and server.

Netflix's routing is a marvel. Considering they use HTTP/1.1 they still are able to squeeze a lot of performance and relatively low load times  considering the content they deliver.|@~~@|15:00 nginx doesn't have QUIC / HTTP/3 yet  as of a month ago nginx-quic is being merged into mainline and still isn't out yet. I'm sure netflix is waiting for that and waiting for it to be polished and experimenting in the meantime.
Also with http/1.1 and multiple server / client load balancing  they can open as many requests as they want.. 6 per server  that is why you saw no white bars.
The thumbnails on the bar that save in memory are every 10 seconds because they're just the keyframe.. frames  which are every 10 seconds by default in most encoding|@~~@|This is absolutely fantastic! The amount of information is mind blowing! Thanks for doing this  you really got me hooked ;)|@~~@|I find client side load balancing and downloading all thumbnails into memory interesting|@~~@|I've just started learning back-end developement and your tips on optimization and security are pretty cool and useful|@~~@|That's once again a great video by Mr. Nasser. Netflix has a much better web app than almost all of it's competitors  and it's pretty interesting to know the technical decisions they make|@~~@|I love this series! Maybe you can do something similar for viewer submissions as well in the future?|@~~@|Found your channel from Mental Outlaw's Youtube suggestions  So glad I did because this is the kind of content I have been dying to find. Signed up for your NGINX udemy course (couldn't catch the python backend course sale in time though) and subbed. Excited to see more from you!|@~~@|LOVE watching these videos  super entertaining  and they make me feel like I actually know something!|@~~@|these always stretch my thinking. In the past  I would've been more judgmental about so many requests on the same domain on http 1.1  but I'm sure the decision to switch is more nuanced than I understand.|@~~@|Everytime I watch your video  I feel like  I need to learn a lot  which excites me to continue watching more and more. Can binge watch the whole devtooling |@~~@|I have learned a lot in this dev tooling session. Very interesting!|@~~@|Very interesting to see what is going on behind the scenes! Great series!! |@~~@|Netflix‘s main infrastructure is on AWS  however many of the streaming servers are outside of the cloud and near local internet service providers to decrease latency for users and save bandwidth costs.|@~~@|Absolutely love this series|@~~@|Client side loadbalancing is definitely interesting  but makes perfect sense for video streaming
Server-side loadbalancing is great  as it's able to spread the cpu load across servers  but for video streaming the bottleneck is not CPU but bandwidth
So If you had a server-side loadbalancer it woud be incredibly hard to have any one or even multiple that's able to handle the bandwidth|@~~@|I store all the preview thumbnails in one sprite and just display a section. Youtube does this too but stores it in multiple sprites.
I know you don't want to risk and deal with it  but this classifies as fair use for research purposes "

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(
Please keep giving us advice. |@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer. There are still so many things need to learn in the Java platform. Do you have any plan to release any new videos/courses on Mockito  Microservice? It’s hard to find good content on those topics. I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

Thanks for sharing this wake up call for identity protection.|@~~@|I worked in a company for ten years suddenly they closed it. my life suddenly went dark... I am very professional in my work but i am totally outdated. i had to start from scratch to learn new technologies and its hard to restart yourself from zero again. most of the people failed and compromise with same old job because of their financial problems. so keep jumping from one point to another point  even water goes bad if it stays in one place.|@~~@|Love the video.  I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.  Couple of things though:  I'm still encapsulated in imposter syndrome when it comes to looking at different opportunities.  How do I ask for 6 figures while dealing with that.  Secondly  where are those 6 figure jobs?  I'm in the Portland Oregon area and am not seeing much that I would qualify for with only 2 years.|@~~@|On this July 31 (within one month) I will complete two years in my current company and accidentally YouTube suggests me this video.

I've been working in my first job for over 2 5 years.|@~~@|You're right Ahmad  if you dont have any more things to learn  it's better to change.
But what do you think about changing in this pandemic time? Is it a good idea? What do you think?|@~~@|Thank you so much sir for  your advice. waiting for lesson 11 and on...
you are doing great work by spreading knowledge...|@~~@|you are 100% correct about the identity. I havejust completed 2 years at my company as an entry lvl data analyst and they still view me as a junior  it is very true that your bosses won't let you come up and give you a raise because they still view you us a jr.
Time to lvl up!!!|@~~@|A collegue of mine told me the exact same about the salery. They wont increase your salery big time because then they need to do that for everyone. They would risk the few that leaves|@~~@|Woow  i got a new job after 11 years on my first tech company! I can't really belive that this video was released when i was searching if i should move on or not.

Thank you.|@~~@|Exceptional course!! Well done! Really helpful and totally easy to follow! Keep up the good work :)|@~~@|Your lessons are really wonderful. Thank you so very much. However  under the Randarray assignment where the objective was to generate revenues and profits for the various sales personnel  some profit figures were greater than the corresponding revenues. Is that possible?|@~~@|Its great to be able to do courses like this one  thank you so much for letting me learn for free.|@~~@|Best educational and technical training channel by far.

I learned so much from your clear and concise explanations  and I am now much more confident in my ability to use Excel.



I particularly appreciated the way you took the time to explain the underlying concepts of Excel  as well as the practical applications of these concepts. This made it much easier for me to understand how Excel works and how I can use it to solve real-world problems.|@~~@|Thank you so much for this tutorial  the Instructor has done a superb job  keep it up.|@~~@|Great teaching and i'm enjoying the class  i downloaded the course file but most of the section and exercise files where showing error  the file name has been changed or moved... is there a way these can be fixed?|@~~@|Hi.

10:34 REST API|@~~@|Hi Rahul  
I have completed your RestAssured course on Udemy  I am not sure if database access and verification is covered there. Could you create a tutorial on that ?|@~~@|Hello Rahul 
I have completed your entire course on Udemy. It was a great course and helped me learn the topic in depth. But  I did not find Digest authentication in the course. Could you pls explain the concept of digest authentication with an example?|@~~@|Hello Rahul  I have taken up you Rest Assured API training in Udemy. It is very helpful. The way you have started with Rest Assured and extended it to Cucumber is very good. Since serenity BDD is good in reporting part  Do you have any plans to add up API testing with Serenity + Cucumber ?|@~~@|Hello Rahu  I really love your talent and the way you teaches. Please do you have any video for CONFLUENCE training?|@~~@|I am learning a lots from your YouTube and Udemy videos  such a wonderful instructor you are  as I am from non it background  and clearing my doubts from all of your s videos.|@~~@|Excellent video sir...Its very clear and useful for the interview preparations. Please post some videos for POSTMAN as well.|@~~@|The way you explain is awesome. We can see and hear your explanation which make easy to understand and to remember as well. Thank you so much!|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir  ....u r always wonderful at your explanation...I m one of u  r student at Udemy .|@~~@|Thank you so much Rahul. This has be very useful for my interview and you have great teaching skills.|@~~@|The interviewer may also ask you about tokens  types of tokens (SWT  SAML  JWT). Besides  he may ask you to define the JSON structure format. It looks like a 'key value' structure type. And REST is not a protocol. It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not. While post we do not require to specific about the index or on which resource we have to do a update operation where are in POST a new resource gets created with ID auto-generated.  Requesting you to modify the answer on video 26:41|@~~@|Thank You Rahul Sir that was amazing refreshing session. Now I'm confident for my interview.|@~~@|Hello  Rahul Great I have enrolled in your course a few days back getting interested in API more.
Q. Will the interviewer asks to write a code also? If giving an automation interview. Like for selenium interviews they ask.|@~~@|This is best video on youtube on api testing interview questions. You explanation is awesome. Anyone can crack interviews easily.|@~~@|Thank you Rahul for the quick guide. It will be definitely helpful.|@~~@|Thanks Rahul sir for providing us information for Rest api. I am regular viewer of your Videos. I have a query if you can guide me in this. Actually i need to test an application in which i need to get the records/orders for like iphone in last 1 min using Rest api. SO how can i achieve it.|@~~@|Hello Rahul  very nice explanation. Thanks a lot.|@~~@|If we use POST instead of PUT then it will create a new record then my intention was to update the existing data  now how POST was used in place of PUT."

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(
Please keep giving us advice. |@~~@|Hello Imtiaz  your courses helped me got an internship and followed by full time offer. There are still so many things need to learn in the Java platform. Do you have any plan to release any new videos/courses on Mockito  Microservice? It’s hard to find good content on those topics. I know you went over testing on your spring boot course but eagerly waiting for any new update. Keep up the good work.|@~~@|I agree  but there are more other important factors. It also depend on job security. Some people working on big companies don't want to move and lose their permanent job. Also if you are young  many people retired  or the company expand and they need new leaders  so you can also apply new positions within the same company and advance your career.|@~~@|As a developer of 4 years experience  that last point related to ""identity"" touched me seriously.

Thanks for sharing this wake up call for identity protection.|@~~@|I worked in a company for ten years suddenly they closed it. my life suddenly went dark... I am very professional in my work but i am totally outdated. i had to start from scratch to learn new technologies and its hard to restart yourself from zero again. most of the people failed and compromise with same old job because of their financial problems. so keep jumping from one point to another point  even water goes bad if it stays in one place.|@~~@|Love the video.  I'm at 3 years as a programmer analysist straight out of a tech bootcamp.  I can relate to all of your points.  Couple of things though:  I'm still encapsulated in imposter syndrome when it comes to looking at different opportunities.  How do I ask for 6 figures while dealing with that.  Secondly  where are those 6 figure jobs?  I'm in the Portland Oregon area and am not seeing much that I would qualify for with only 2 years.|@~~@|On this July 31 (within one month) I will complete two years in my current company and accidentally YouTube suggests me this video. How lucky am I !! Really helpful video ️|@~~@|Perfect time for this video. I've been working in my first job for over 2 5 years.|@~~@|You're right Ahmad  if you dont have any more things to learn  it's better to change.
But what do you think about changing in this pandemic time? Is it a good idea? What do you think?|@~~@|Thank you so much sir for  your advice. waiting for lesson 11 and on...
you are doing great work by spreading knowledge...|@~~@|you are 100% correct about the identity. I havejust completed 2 years at my company as an entry lvl data analyst and they still view me as a junior  it is very true that your bosses won't let you come up and give you a raise because they still view you us a jr.
Time to lvl up!!!|@~~@|A collegue of mine told me the exact same about the salery. They wont increase your salery big time because then they need to do that for everyone. They would risk the few that leaves|@~~@|Woow  i got a new job after 11 years on my first tech company! I can't really belive that this video was released when i was searching if i should move on or not. Now on this new IT company working almost 3 month i will say that all he talks in the video is TRUE! And most important guys & girls  the Identity. Its all on you what you want people to know about you in your next work.|@~~@|Hi Imtiaz i want to learn python for data science and machine learning  i have taken a few courses on udemy and coursera  but i mainly find them too superficial and not in enough depth  any suggestions? or is something related coming on job ready programmer  soon ? :)|@~~@|3 years i had 4-5 jobs. Not a software developer but still it's cool to have experienced 2 foreign countries and work in different environment... |@~~@|I'm a data analyst and I have learnt SQL using your course and want to start my career as a SQL Developer.  Do you recommend finding a junior level job first even though the pay might be lower than my current role?Thanks|@~~@|I wish I had seen this or got some advice like this when I was a fresher.

In a word she is the best teacher out there.|@~~@|I'm taking the course right now and so far  it's really good. I have zero experience in programming but Angela explains it clearly which makes it easier for me to follow.|@~~@|I'm taking the course with Dr.Angela on Udemy. The course really great. Even though I use English as my second language and I have a hard time to speak read and write  but she make the course easy to follow with clear explanation.  Just my opinion She is a the best professor for all developers. I highly recommended her course to everyone.|@~~@|I have both her course and web dev course from Colt Steele. To be honest Angela's course is great  however  she does cut off some basics on the earlier stage of HTML and CSS. For example  earlier on you spent time learning about tables and floats  which is hardly being used now. But she didn't touch about  CSS flex-box or CSS grid. Later when you jumped in framework such as Bootstrap  it was a bit fast  and I'm not against using frameworks  but you really need to have a strong understanding about how HTML and CSS works first  and then you can use frameworks to work faster (if you need it and don't mind the design it gives you). |@~~@|The CSS section is the best hands down. colt  andrei or jonas dont even come close. I used to always fear CSS especially things like display and position but now I feel totally comfortable.


currently in HTML/CSS section hope the remaining sections wil also be great as the first sections|@~~@|Really  she is a great tutor and she gives more informations and resources in this course. I learned a lot from this course.|@~~@|I have been enjoying her class immensely. I do wish I knew the front end and back end earlier. 
The thing that gives me anxiety is not knowing if I could impress potential employers when I finish this course. My intention of to apply for web development jobs when I finish all my Udemy courses.|@~~@|I stopped Angela course when I finished frontend sadly.
Actually she is the best teacher I ever met in my entire life.
She doesn't give you just the content  also she teach you how to walk and tell you how to run the field.
I tried to learn from other tutorials.|@~~@|I am looking for full stack developer course. Should I go with this one or is there any other better options also in udemy?|@~~@|I just bought her course. Can't wait to start!|@~~@|Best teacher ever period.|@~~@|As far as I know node.js is a   javascript runtime environment and not a programming language like you mentioned @4:13 and @4:17|@~~@|Thank you. Very helpful|@~~@|I  as a beginner who is looking to change career paths and has no experience at all like the fact that you are offering to be a mentor. I also wonder if the region that I am from plays a part in what is popular: ie react & ojs etc?|@~~@|Do you have anyone who does mentor programs for the Computer challenged ? I really liked your video on APP development but found it overwhelming.|@~~@|Angela's course are the best.. very inspring too|@~~@|I am a complete beginner who is interested in front developer path. Which course is best for me? Colt or Angela course?|@~~@|Your explanation of the cons do offer some different insights. I always get lost in Angela's voice|@~~@|Hi

When I watched the Web Development Practical Guide 2018 almost 5 years ago  I was just coding a “Guess My Number Game” on HTML and now I am watching 2023’s guide as a Full stack Dev with a YouTube channel documenting my progress.

The calm way that Brad talks  without beating around the bush  without saying ""this is too easy"" reflects a lot of the respect he has for the profession and the love he puts into every video he makes. Thank you Brad. Today I am a senior frontend developer thanks to the basics I learned with you. You are a hero.|@~~@|It's wild that this content just exists out here for free  thanks to Brad's commitment and hard work. You're a beast Brad  my sincerest thank you.|@~~@|2 Years ago I watched Brad's Html for beginners video for the first time in my life I came across web development. It was a long journey I learned everything about the front end and now I'm able to get my first job and ended up with some offers. Many of them put me on hold but one of them is giving me an opportunity in a few days I'm starting my first position. Still  last month I became really depressed and a lot of things were crushing my mind (you know how it goes with frickin procrastination) and I started to watch this video  it got me boosted again and it got me ""back on track""!! So I wanted to say THANK YOU BRAD  it's always a pleasure to listen to you and in some way you make it so clear and calm me down and show me the way. You are the Jesus of tutorials . I LOVE YOU MAN! |@~~@|Brad what you and the Traversy Media Team are doing for the community  you guys are gems  Can't thank you enough for everything you teach us|@~~@|Best 3 hours I have spent on Youtube  period! Most useful and concise video I have encountered in my software development learning journey. It puts everything in perspective and has given me a so much more complete overview of what is out there. Brad knows his stuff  and has his preferences  but clearly explains everything you need to know as it relates to you and what you want to do. Amazing quality  knowledge  and thought put into this project. Thanks Brad  your work is a gift to the development community!|@~~@|These guides are invaluable! It's hard to keep an overview when having been away from the web dev space for a while  and while some frameworks have been around for years  the landscape is constantly changing and there are just so many topics to keep track of. So thanks for this!|@~~@|The guide many developers have been waiting for.  This channel is a MUST for developers on YouTube.|@~~@|Another year and just like all the ones here in the past I have returned for the daily update! Already a seasoned full stack developer  but nonetheless these videos help me me determine course for the rest of the year. Thanks Brad for making this possible. |@~~@|I hope to land my first coding job this year.  Looking forward to watching this video for help.  Thanks for your consistent content to help us who are aspiring to break into the tech industry.|@~~@|The fact that you take the time to do this long of a video is very much appreciated. I just finished the whole thing and it was done right. Very thorough and congrats on the 2 million.|@~~@|Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer  mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines  it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such  I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver  repeatedly drifted away  and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse  only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?|@~~@|PHD course in WEB DEV... Much thanks Brad. Looking for the next year of Personal Growth with YOUR HELP!|@~~@|Thank you Brad for such an amazing content like every Year is probably the most awaited video from the community. Just one little annotation is that  C# is also part of the wasm languajes. Since I also worked with C# and now from the last years also work with JS it would be great if you can create content also on C#|@~~@|It ain't a good year if I'm watching Brad's new guide on webdev. 
5 years ago I coded a platform for my school using Laravel and Bootstrap 3. Now I'm a backend dev at a EdTech company and I love what I do. Thanks for the great work you do on these. May you be compensated fairly by the Universe.|@~~@|Immense quality! Tons of really valuable info and knowledge provided in here.

It's is a software architectural style.|@~~@|Q-13: Can we use POST request instead of PUT to create a resource ?   Your answer is Wrong. We can not.

Found the channel via Spring Boot 2.6 video.

This leaves me with a rather rudimentary question.
Since it is fully possible to code constructor injection (with arguments) without the Spring Framework (since this is how I've been doing dependency in my non-Spring code bases like AWS Lambdas)  what are the other benefits that are provided by Spring  purely from the standpoint of constructor injection?

The S3 documentation says: ""...previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance  and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes."".|@~~@|I literally love this teacher!

I particularly like the ease of the presentation  the clear voice and the professional architectural diagrams with the summary of the services involved. It is clear you put a lot of efforts into preparing the materials  so this is really appreciated. 
With regard to the AWS Fault Tolerence architecture  I could see there are 2 models  one with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and the other with Elasttic IP. Each model has multi AZ setup. So I would like to know if the two models interact with each other or whether they are independent or if they are in different regisions like a multi AZ and multi regions setup. |@~~@|Awesome Syed! I found this course very illuminating. I especially liked the AWS Codestar and CI/CD pipelines guides. Thank you for sharing your deep understanding in these areas.|@~~@|Hey syed  Love your videos.

Now  while I do understand it is related and one is in a way consistent in the other  and also some people skip thw ccp and go right for the architect exam  my question would be- what do you recomment I read primarily as additional and new info that pertains more to the architect exam  and not so much the repeatable material?

Sadly most people prefer sick around .:-(

MIght sound weird  but I find they have an ASMR quality that makes me want to keep listening to them :-)|@~~@|Hey Ryan  this is off topic  but istead a recommendation for making your videos: it is generally advisable to raise the key light to at least eye level or even higher - it gets rid of shadows on the face created by glasses for example  and it also helps creating a nice contour of the speaker's face. My second advice is to position/rotate the microphone more towards yourself. It looks like a Rode USB mic that has a cardioid pick up pattern which means it's fairly directional.
