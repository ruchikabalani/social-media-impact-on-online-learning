# social-media-impact-on-online-learning
In the rapidly evolving landscape of online education, Udemy stands as a cornerstone platform,
providing a diverse range of courses since its establishment in 2010. However, the challenge
faced by instructors extends beyond delivering quality content to the effective expansion of their reach and engagement with their audience. Notably, platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube have emerged as influential players, reshaping the dynamics of online education.

Our study delves into this dynamic by closely collaborating with John Doe, a seasoned Udemy
instructor grappling with the disparity between the exceptional quality of his courses and the
anticipated audience engagement. Leveraging the transformative evolution of LinkedIn into a
content-sharing platform and YouTube's strategic shift towards enabling content creators to
monetize, our project investigates the correlation between social media engagement on LinkedIn and YouTube and the popularity of Udemy courses.

The primary focus of our analysis involves a comprehensive examination of Udemy, LinkedIn,
and YouTube datasets. By scrutinizing variables such as Instructor Name, Number of students,
Udemy Rating, LinkedIn and YouTube Followers, Posting Frequency, and engagement metrics,
including likes, dislikes, views, and comments, we aim to provide empirical substantiation for
the impact of social media engagement on Udemy course sales.

While our project acknowledges the importance of content engagement alignment, it intentionally narrows its scope to the specific dimension of engagement that has the potential to transform instructors' online presence. Through this research, we aspire to offer John Doe and other instructors valuable insights into optimizing their engagement strategies on LinkedIn and YouTube to enhance the popularity of their Udemy courses.
