8,6,"I just finished watching your course ""Programming 101"" on Udemy. So glad I did. I will be continuing my journey of learning software development and I am happy to have a more intimate understanding of how computers work. Thank you."
9,6,Hi mate! A few years ago I have seen some of your videos  but then I've lost your channel. Nowadays I'm learning programming again in a more structured form  at a BootCamp but often I have hardships understanding some topic explanations there. Of course  there are hundreds of videos on youtube about each topic  but sometimes they doesn't help me either. Somewhere in my mind  I remembered you  your face  your voice  your explanations  that you were very clear at some topics a few years ago. Today I tried to find you and luckily  I'm here. I have remembered you explaining once that many programmers mismatch the word argument and parameter. This memory led me to succeed in finding your channel. I typed this into the youtube search and I'm glad I got you! I'm going to dig deeper on your channel in the next few months and I think  you gonna be one of my favorite tutors from now on!
10,6,Super helpful insight into Web 3! The future of the internet sounds interesting.
11,6,In your Moralis example  does Moralis have the power to view the data before they insert it into the blockchain? If yes  does that leave them exposed to government intervention? Is the data stored by Moralis after being inserted into the blockchain?
12,6,Very insightful. Came to learn about Web3 and learnt things I didn't know about blockchain.
13,6,Spot on  pretty much everything you said is correct here  and then some!
14,6,does this have implications for carbon footprint of the web?
15,6,They won't need to harass the company anymore because they can just find it in the blockchain themselves. This is the most foolish endeavor and backwards thinking I have EVER heard of. The security of this is PURELY based on obfuscation.
16,6,Which blockchain is most Web3 friendly?  Ethereum or some other?  I keep hearing Web3 is Ethereum based... not true?
17,6,Good job. I think there is also some kind of platform generation difference too. Like Bitcoin is generation 1  Etherium is generation 2  and Polkadot is generation 3.
18,7,Sir  Kindly Explain how to deal with the Balance Sheets with Negative Capital please...

49,11,I really like the teaching style and lessons from Simon Sez  especially this instructor.  I signed up for their Excel Business Analysis course because it had a lot of great worksheets (and others like MS Project  Alteryx  etc ).  Just wish they had these instructions when I started out using the different software (I just find it too challenging to learn from books  or web articles  which was my primary learning method years ago).
50,11,Hello Deborah and the whole simon sez family  thank u guys very much for this wonderful course. It was learner's centered rather than teacher centered. I just finished it. What a lovely style of teaching.
51,11,At 5.5 Hours. Best tutorial ever taken. To the point  no fluff. Thank you.
52,11,Exceptional course!! Well done! Really helpful and totally easy to follow! Keep up the good work :)
53,11,Your lessons are really wonderful. Thank you so very much. However  under the Randarray assignment where the objective was to generate revenues and profits for the various sales personnel  some profit figures were greater than the corresponding revenues. Is that possible?
54,11,Its great to be able to do courses like this one  thank you so much for letting me learn for free.
55,11,Best educational and technical training channel by far. Clarity  Focused and Learner friendly .
56,11,Very nice teaching style  specific to the point many thanks 3:28:00
57,11,Thanks for helping me perfect my skills in Excel  your teaching  style is apt and great instructors.
58,11,"I am writing to thank you for the excellent Excel training that I recently completed on your YouTube channel. I learned so much from your clear and concise explanations  and I am now much more confident in my ability to use Excel.



I particularly appreciated the way you took the time to explain the underlying concepts of Excel  as well as the practical applications of these concepts. This made it much easier for me to understand how Excel works and how I can use it to solve real-world problems."
59,11,Thank you so much for this tutorial  the Instructor has done a superb job  keep it up.
60,11,Great teaching and i'm enjoying the class  i downloaded the course file but most of the section and exercise files where showing error  the file name has been changed or moved... is there a way these can be fixed?
61,11,Hi. Firstly  thank you so much for this EXCELLENT course.  I am learning so much.  I am in the last lesson of the Intermediate section: 06-07 calculate dates with edate and eomonth  but the Instructor File for this lesson is not in the download packet.
62,11,Great skills to teach.. I really enjoy learning from your videos
63,11,Thank You   for a great course  and the voice of the instructor is pleasant to the ear. I am learning a ton and easily.
64,11,great course  Does it include graphing data on excel ?
65,11,Thanks for the tutorial. I learned a lot from it. Can we get a certificate of conclusion to post it on LinkedIn?
66,11,Just perfect well done

An dieser Stelle mÃ¶chte ich einmal Danke sagen fÃ¼r deine Motivation und  deine Mission die du in die Welt bringst. Mach weiter so  DankeschÃ¶n"
88,22,"Danke fÃ¼r deine direkte Art und dein Wissen  dass du uns weitergibst! freue mich auf dein Buch 
LG Cordula"
89,22,Deine Videos sind wirklich klasse! Ich finde es super  wie du komplexe Immobilienkonzepte auf so eine unterhaltsame und verstÃ¤ndliche Art prÃ¤sentierst. Deine Leidenschaft fÃ¼r das Thema ist wirklich spÃ¼rbar und hat mich sogar dazu gebracht  mich selbst intensiver mit Immobilien zu beschÃ¤ftigen. Bitte mach weiter so
90,22,"Herzlichen Dank fÃ¼r die Videoreihe - ich kann Dich bestens empfehlen und jeder Person an Herz legen  sich wirklich um seine finanzielle Zukunft selber verantwortlich zu machen und den ersten Schritt zu tun - zuhÃ¶ren  lernen und tun!
Besten Dank fÃ¼r die BÃ¼cher und die vielen Videos - immer wieder inspirierend."
91,22,Das  Buch kaufe auf jeden Fall ;  Deine Anlegertipps sind  genau so gut   wie die Krisenvorsorgertipps  von Thomas Gast. Denke mit breiter  Information und effektiver Arbeit ist die Krise zu meistern.
92,22,Ich darf mich an dieser Stelle fÃ¼r die (meistens) interessanten BeitrÃ¤ge bedanken. Die Idee eine Einzimmer-Wohnung zu verlosen somit jemanden Starthilfe im GeschÃ¤ftsleben zu geben  ist auch sehr lÃ¶blich. Manchmal braucht es eben einen Input mit unterschiedlichen Ansichten.
93,22,Du bist einzigartig! Bin ein grosser Fan! 
94,22,Hab das Buch soeben vorbestellt* Bisher waren alle deine BÃ¼cher genial*
95,22,Bin schon gespannt auf dein Buch. Das mÃ¶chte ich unbedingt haben.

alleine bis zu Minute 1 stimme ich schon zu 100 % zu!!!
Meine persÃ¶nliche Meinung!"
100,22,Endlich ein neues Buch 
101,22,GroÃartig wie du das machst.
102,22,Es ist so einfach und doch so genial. Du bietest einer Person die Chance eine Wohnung zu gewinnen und selber musst du mit diesem Gewinnspiel nur genug Geld einnehmen  um wieder genÃ¼gend Eigenkapital fÃ¼r die nÃ¤chste Wohnung zu haben. Zack hast du kostengÃ¼nstig Werbung gemacht und deutlich mehr Leads generiert als mit einem normalen Video.
103,22,Would really be great if you could publish subtitles in English with it.
104,22,WÃ¼rde gerne auch Wohnungen kaufen  muss aber erstmal am Einkommen arbeiten... Aber ich sehe es genauso. Es lÃ¤uft alles darauf hinaus  dass jeder sich etwas aufbauen muss  sonst kommste unter die RÃ¤der....
105,22,Moin Gerald  sehr gerne teile ich solche Inhalte. WÃ¼nsche viel Erfolg. Lg JÃ¶rg
106,22,"Ich folge dir jetzt schon sehr lange und habe viele deiner Informationen umgesetzt. Was mich interessiert ist aber wo genau liegt die Wohnung. Ich will ja keinen ""Dreck"" haben. Danke dir."

263,67,After a succession of payouts and compounding interest from generating high ROi in trades  it took me me a little over 8 months to hit six figures. sometimes the only challenge we have s taking the first step forward.
264,67,I like this vid. I also think it's frustrating that so many people advise you to focus on twenty percent or smaller returns. It seems like common sense to invest in cheaper stocks with higher growth potentials. The average person doesn't have a million dollars to invest  so ten to twenty percent returns isn't going to cut it if you want to do this for a living. 
265,67,you make understanding trading stocks so much less complicated then when I listen to other people on youtube speak about stocks
266,67,Great vid Tim  as always to the point.
267,67,Really happy I stumbled upon this so early in the morning. Going to stick to that 30% rule as I begin my journey.
268,67,Subscribed today and I know I'll learn so much. Thnks Tim. Its an Awesome thing you're doing
269,67,Thank you for speaking in Layman's terms for us that know next to nothing! I will be following your posts attempting to learn. Quick question  do you get a rush or surge of adrenaline ever from penny stocks? I'm easily excitable and can see this as a great investment and fun. I sold off my stocks years ago. Danka  Coca Cola  Disney.
270,67,Hey brotha  great video. I enjoy listening to you. You explain things extremely well.
271,67,Thank you for your videos I'm really catching on   I'm positive  this gives me a really good feeling :)
272,67,I love your video  it makes perfect sense and I am just getting into Trading. you don't have to but the house but you definitely have to reinvest and build your bank!  I'd rather have 35% of $100 000 and 35% of 1000
273,67,Hey  I'm a 16 year old wanting to know more about trading  I was wondering if these methods still apply to trading nowadays. Thanks for all the informational content.
274,67,I understand the process now and how to understand not being greedy  reading articles and paying close attention to what company decision. I'm not looking for big risks just something to get a beginner account to gain momentum as you said in the video to be able to risk higher bets and make possible a bigger payout because you took the time to do small but however smart trades. This isn't something im looking to make money on just this  more or less just to be able to fund my hobbies like being a car enthusiast. I just have one question for you  and can you buy and sell stock at anytime? Once you see that it has gone up 30% but you don't want to risk it and it has been an hour since you have BOUGHT or INVESTED in a certain amount of stocks (I hope im correct on that previous statement) can you sell an hour later?
275,67,learning day by day  i know nothing about stock trading so this video helps me understand somewhat to expect thanks tim
276,67,I'm 17 and have been searching for good strategies and wanted to know as much a bout penny stocks as possible. You've helped so much. Also is E-trade good for investing? What's the best company to invest through?
277,67,I'm 15 and I want to learn how to do all this penny stock marketing and this is why I watch you  you are great at what you do  are there any simulators I could start off with so I can learn without losing any money or should I just go straight for it.
278,67,"I'm 14 and I'm so confused on this but it seems really intestine and cool and I want to learn how to do this stuff 
thank you"
279,67,"Chad Hart When it comes to penny stocks  a company's underlying business is even more important than it is in exchange-traded stocks. That's because the penny stock world is home to ""shell"" companies that are legally incorporated  but don't have any business operations."
280,67,"Can barely sleep  so excited to start investing tmrw  never even considered taking advantage of the volatility of penny stocks!
Currently in 3rd year for bus management and all of my profs continuously stress not to invest surprisingly.."

340,85,Dude you're awesome. I'm a DBA and I've been assigned with creating a web app using C#/NET  and months ago I found your channel.... through these API walkthroughs and other suggestions like MudBlazor/Blazor I've been able to make a pretty legit  fully functioning  low code and maintanable app despite not being a programmer that I'm proud of. Thanks for the videos. Recently did a year of skillshare and ill be checking you out there as well.
341,85,Greetings from Finland. I shifted over from development to sales over 10 years ago and started to try out coding again   just for fun. The starting up again is a pain as nothing in the code makes sense. I found your tutorial super beneficial and clear. Thanks for this.
342,85,I'm only 15 minutes into this video but i really  really like your style. I've done a few other tutorials and from what I've seen people either blow through things without explaining or they explain too main minor details without touching on the bigger picture of why things are done a certain way. I can say your tutorial is one of the best I've come across.
343,85,Thank you for such a clear and simplistic tutorial to grasp some knowledge on the new 7 version. You gained a new subscriber :) Great guy!
344,85,Thank you for the awesome vid! My only request to make things more clear for us new devs  is could you leave your solution explorer open on the side? I know ultimately I can see where you are based on the tab names  but the solution explorer is more clear.
345,85,Excellent work @Patrick God   please keep it up and there should be video of real life project example ( user registration  employee registration or a sales invoice ) from creating Table   Strored Procedures  Web Api and Angular
346,85,Hello  thank you for the tutorial. I was wondering if you are planning to do videos on different authentication methods with users accessing our API?
347,85,Greetings! You surely have some of the best tutorials in the game! I wanted to know how I would alter the program to use Cosmos DB. I have tried it on my own but seem to run into many issues. Thanks
348,85,This is the best video I've seen on this topic. You have a talent for explaining things clearly.
349,85,Hola Patrick  mil y un millon de gracias!  tengo una pregunta:  Si quiero conectarme a mas de una base de datos que tienen la misma estructura  como lo harÃ­a?  teniendo en cuenta que el DbContext solo muestra la conexion a una base de datos.
350,85,Good work sir    on your next vlog please show us how to work on Dbfirst with Indentity and multi relational database

Also wanted to ask about your course on Udemy(.NET 7 Web API & Entity Framework Jumpstart) do I have to learn basics of Razor pages before watching it or I'll be fine without Razor?"
